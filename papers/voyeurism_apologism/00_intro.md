# From Peeping Toms to Deepfakes: Tracing the Cultural History of Voyeurism Apologism into the Age of AI Sexploitation

*© Vova (Vladimir) Zakharov, 2025*

### **Abstract**

This paper examines the historical trajectory of voyeurism apologism and its direct ideological lineage to the modern defense of non-consensual deepfake pornography. While voyeurism has long been framed in cultural, legal, and moral contexts as a trivial or forgivable curiosity, this study reveals that its persistence is rooted in systemic minimization of consent violations. Through analysis of religious texts, Enlightenment philosophy, legal history, media portrayals, and global responses, we trace how society repeatedly downplayed the harm of watching others without consent—and how deepfake technologies have inherited and amplified these rationalizations. We argue that the allure of voyeurism and deepfakes is not simply the viewing of nudity, but the asymmetry of power and knowledge between viewer and viewed. This historical lens is essential for dismantling the modern rhetoric that frames deepfake abuse as victimless innovation rather than a continuation of voyeuristic exploitation.

### **Introduction**

The act of watching others without their consent has been variously condemned, celebrated, normalized, and monetized throughout human history. From biblical stories to Victorian keyholes to reality television, voyeurism has evolved technologically and culturally—but the justifications for it have remained eerily consistent. In this paper, we explore the historical patterns of **voyeurism apologism**—the rhetorical and social mechanisms used to downplay or excuse non-consensual watching—and demonstrate how these same patterns are now repackaged in defenses of **deepfake pornography**, particularly in its non-consensual forms.

The paper proceeds in seven sections, followed by a conclusion:

* **I. Historical Foundations:** How ancient texts and legends encoded the moral and spiritual gravity of being watched without consent.
* **II. Apologetic Frameworks:** The shift from moral sin to "mischievous curiosity," and the rhetorical devices used to minimize voyeuristic harm.
* **III. Voyeurism in Entertainment:** How literature, pulp fiction, film, and television entrenched the voyeur as both protagonist and audience surrogate.
* **IV. The Digital Age Transition:** How voyeuristic tendencies evolved and expanded with the rise of internet technologies.
* **V. Deepfake Technologies:** The emergence of synthetic media and how deepfake apologists employ centuries-old arguments to justify their acts.
* **VI. Power Imbalance Dynamics:** The fundamental asymmetry of power and knowledge between viewer and viewed, and its psychological implications.
* **VII. Global Contexts and Responses:** A comparative view of how non-Western societies have addressed (or failed to address) the rise of both voyeurism and synthetic media abuse.

Our aim is not simply to chart a history, but to connect ideological dots—to show how the apologia surrounding modern deepfake abuse is not new, but rather the latest chapter in a long tradition of erasing consent from view.

### **Previous Work**

Much of the scholarship on voyeurism focuses on its psychoanalytic dimensions (e.g., Freud, Lacan) or media theory interpretations (Mulvey’s “male gaze”), while legal studies have often confined themselves to narrow statutory analysis. Recent scholarship has turned toward image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), including deepfake pornography, with work by McGlynn, Johnson, and Citron foregrounding its harms and the urgent need for regulation.

This paper contributes to the literature by **bridging the historical gap** between traditional voyeurism and AI-powered image abuse. While deepfakes have been examined in legal and ethical contexts, few studies have directly connected the **rhetorical continuity** between historical voyeurism apologism and modern defenses of synthetic non-consensual content. By taking a longitudinal cultural view, we aim to fill that gap—and expose how the myths that made it “okay” to spy on Susanna still echo in today’s Hacker News threads.
