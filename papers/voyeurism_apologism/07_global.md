## Global Perspectives: Voyeurism and Image Abuse Beyond the West

Though much of our focus has been on Western cultural history, other societies have grappled with voyeurism and related abuses in their own contexts. In **Japan**, voyeurism in modern times became so prevalent that it spawned its own disturbing sub-industry. The term *chikan* is often associated with groping on trains, but equally pernicious is *tosatsu* – secret photography of women (often upskirt shots). In the late 90s and early 2000s, as camera phones hit the market, incidents of men snapping illicit photos on subways and in stores exploded. The problem grew so notorious that Japanese phone manufacturers implemented a mandatory shutter sound on all phone cameras that can’t be muted – a technological fix meant to deter sneaky photographers. This was reinforced by legal measures: by 2015, laws explicitly banned silencing the camera shutter, aligning with privacy protection ordinances. A high-profile catalyst was the **Masashi Tashiro incident** in 2000. Tashiro, a former pop idol, was caught trying to film up a woman’s skirt with his cell phone and was arrested. The case shocked the public (and was actually one of several voyeurism-related arrests for Tashiro, whose career imploded amid these “peeping” crimes). The outcry helped spur the industry and lawmakers to ensure phones made a loud *click* – a rare instance of engineering to curb voyeurism at the source. Even so, cunning voyeurs adapted, using small standalone devices or devising apps to suppress the sound. Japan’s experience underscores how **deeply embedded voyeurism was in parts of the culture** – to the point that basic everyday tech had to be constrained to protect privacy.

Japan also has a well-documented market for illicit voyeur videos. For years, adult video stores (and later online sites) sold content labeled as “hidden camera” footage – sometimes actually staged, but often marketed as genuine spycam captures. This fetishization of non-consensual images created a feedback loop: high demand incentivized more covert filming. In recent years the Japanese government has tightened laws against such distribution, and police periodically bust rings of hidden cam producers. Yet the **apologetic framing** persists in some quarters. Consumers tell themselves the videos are victimless if the women’s faces are blurred (ignoring that the women never agreed to be filmed at all). The act of watching someone who “doesn’t know they’re being watched” is fetishized, not seen as criminal. Culturally, Japan has had to reckon with this, balancing a historical norm of strict public modesty against an underground reality of voyeuristic exploits.

Moving to **South Korea**, as mentioned, the country has faced what officials call a *spycam epidemic*. Tiny cameras in motel rooms, public toilets, school dorms – virtually nowhere has been off-limits. By the mid-2010s, tens of thousands of cases were being reported, and women took to the streets in mass protests. In 2018, around 22,000 women marched in Seoul holding signs like “My Life is Not Your Porn”. They demanded tougher penalties and an end to the pervasive normalization of these crimes. Part of what they were fighting is precisely *voyeurism apologism*: for too long, many Korean men (and some authorities) treated spycam antics as a pesky byproduct of the digital age or *“a part of daily life”* that one must tolerate. President Moon Jae-in acknowledged the problem and pushed for action, and indeed punishments have increased, though activists say enforcement still has far to go. In South Korea’s case, there is also a **digital vigilante element**: women began sweeping public bathrooms for hidden lenses, a practice born out of necessity. That such measures are needed speaks to how deeply the *it’s just for fun* or *for male camaraderie* mindset had taken root among perpetrators. Only sustained public pressure has started to shift the narrative toward *“this is a serious sex crime.”* Additionally, South Korea saw instances of *deepfake-like abuse* early on – e.g., celebrities’ faces pasted on porn images, or private individuals’ faces used in app-generated nudes – prompting the government to include synthetic media in its definition of illegal porn distribution. In 2021, the country amended laws to explicitly criminalize making or sharing sexual images synthesized without consent, a move ahead of many Western countries.

Other non-Western societies have their own angles. In India, for example, *voyeurism* was explicitly added as a criminal offense in the Penal Code in 2013 (after a notorious gangrape case prompted a broad overhaul of sexual offense laws). Indian law now punishes anyone who watches or captures images of a woman engaging in a private act, if done without consent, recognizing the humiliation it causes. This came after numerous hidden cam scandals – from spycams in changing rooms to the circulation of an MMS clip of two consenting adults that was leaked and went viral, ruining the woman’s life. Traditionally, South Asian cultures strongly emphasize female modesty, so voyeurism often results in severe social consequences for the woman (victim) – a dynamic that doubly victimizes her. Nonetheless, the legal reforms indicate progress in seeing the act itself as the crime, not the state of the woman’s dress or behavior.

In the Middle East, strict morality laws would ostensibly make voyeurism a grave sin (and indeed, if caught, a voyeur could face harsh punishment or street justice). Yet, anecdotally, the segregation of genders and difficulty of dating in some of these countries can fuel a different kind of voyeurism – men may resort to peeping for sexual gratification in societies where contact between unmarried men and women is forbidden. This again can be tacitly excused as an outlet for natural urges in an unnatural social setting. Thus, even where religious law uncompromisingly forbids it, the *apologetic narrative* finds a way when societal conditions drive the behavior underground.

What emerges from these global snapshots is that **voyeurism – and its modern digital manifestations – is a universal challenge**, but cultures vary in their response. Some East Asian societies have been forced by sheer volume of incidents to publicly confront and condemn the practice (e.g. large public awareness campaigns in Korea, technology mandates in Japan). Others are just beginning to discuss it. Everywhere, however, a common thread is visible: the struggle to move past *“harmless”* or *inevitable* characterizations and to recognize the real harm to those whose privacy and dignity are stolen.
