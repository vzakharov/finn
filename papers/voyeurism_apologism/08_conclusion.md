## Conclusion: From Voyeur to Deepfaker – Breaking the Apologia Cycle

Tracing the evolution of voyeurism apologism from biblical times to the age of AI reveals a sobering pattern. Time and again, advances in technology or shifts in cultural milieu have given voyeurs new ways to intrude on privacy – from the Renaissance keyhole to the Kodak camera, from the camcorder to the deepfake generator. And each time, society’s initial response has tended to lag, mired in old biases: *boys will be boys*, *it’s only natural curiosity*, *no harm if no one’s hurt*. The parallels between secret peepers of yesteryear and deepfake creators today are uncanny – not because the acts are identical in method, but because the **justifications sound like echoes across centuries**. Both depend on a willful blindness to the importance of consent. Both downplay the power imbalance at play. Both often shift blame to the victim or to abstract societal forces, rather than the individual choice to violate someone’s privacy.

Yet, history also shows an arc (albeit a slow one) bending toward accountability. What was once written off as *scandalous mischief* eventually came to be seen as a breach of fundamental rights. We see this in the gradual strengthening of voyeurism laws and the increasingly widespread recognition that image-based abuses cause real trauma. In the discourse on AI ethics and tech accountability, deepfakes have become a key concern, and rightly so. They force us to confront questions that are not actually new: Will we allow new technology to become an excuse for old abuses? Will we accept a culture where anyone’s likeness can be seized for entertainment, echoing the era when peeping Toms skated by because their crime was invisible and chuckle-worthy? Or will we apply the hard-earned lessons of the past? Those lessons tell us that **we must put consent and dignity at the center**, and expose apologetic tropes for what they are – attempts to permit cruelty under the guise of normalcy.

In pushing back against deepfake apologism, we are in effect finishing the work of pushing back against voyeurism apologism. It is a continuation of the same struggle in a new theater. The conversation is admittedly complex: it touches on free expression, the nature of “reality” in media, and even artistic license. But certain points admit no ambiguity: **non-consensual sexual depiction is a violation**, be it through a keyhole or through code. The person who perpetrates it is not a folk hero of curiosity or a harmless prankster; he (or she) is treading on someone’s autonomy. And the person subjected to it is not oversensitive for feeling violated; they stand in a line of victims from Susanna onward who have every right to cry foul and demand justice.

Ultimately, shining a light on these historical and cultural evolutions arms us with understanding. It allows us to *name* the old excuses when we hear them in new packaging. The next time someone shrugs off deepfake porn as just inevitable “boys being boys with tech,” we can recall how that same excuse was used to ignore women’s pleas about peepers in fitting rooms – and we can remind them that society decided such behavior was unacceptable. The trajectory of voyeurism apologism teaches that **cultural attitudes can change**. What was once “provocative but not dry” titillation in a pulp magazine can become recognized as an abusive invasion in court. Likewise, the more we draw these parallels in public discourse – making it clear that deepfakes are part of an ongoing story of voyeuristic abuse – the harder it will be for apologists to hide behind pseudo-innocuous rhetoric.

In the end, holding **tech accountable** for how it enables abuse goes hand in hand with holding *people* accountable for how they use it. The camera, the internet, the algorithm – none are inherently evil, but all have been tools for those who seek the illicit thrill of seeing without being seen. It falls to society to remove the cloak of permissiveness that has too often shrouded the voyeurs. By learning from the past – from that ancient garden in Babylon where elders ogled Susanna, to the Victorian keyhole, to the pixelated faces on a fake video – we can better craft laws, norms, and technologies that affirm one simple principle: **there is nothing “harmless” about violating someone’s consent, no matter how cleverly or quietly it’s done**. And when we, as a culture, fully embrace that principle, the apologias that have excused voyeurism in all its guises will finally ring hollow.
