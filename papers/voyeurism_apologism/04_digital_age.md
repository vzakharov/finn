## The Digital Age: Hidden Cameras, Webcams, and Online Peeping

With the advent of inexpensive cameras and the internet in the late 20th century, voyeurism found new mediums and new excuses. Suddenly, the peeping Tom didn’t need a ladder and a keyhole – a mini camera or later a smartphone could do the trick. **Hidden camera incidents surged**: tiny lenses in dressing rooms, bathrooms, locker rooms, and shoe tips (for upskirt shots) became a worldwide plague. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the early web was littered with “voyeur” sites boasting clandestine footage. Some were semi-consensual (*JenniCam* famously live-streamed a young woman’s private life with her permission), but many were outright covert. It was the era of the “camgirl” but also of the **“web peeper.”** One notorious example occurred in 1998: a live-site claimed to show a college dorm room shower via a hidden cam, drawing millions of prurient hits until authorities intervened. In these nascent digital cases, perpetrators often fell back on old defenses in a new guise. “It’s just a prank,” “I was just curious,” or “everyone was doing it online” – such was the rhetoric, even as victims grappled with the knowledge that untold strangers had violated their privacy.

Legal systems scrambled to catch up. Lawmakers who had rarely dealt with peeping beyond local ordinances now faced the **age of “video voyeurs.”** By the early 2000s, a wave of legislation rolled out: the U.S. passed the federal Video Voyeurism Prevention Act in 2004, many states enacted specific anti-voyeurism statutes, and the UK’s Sexual Offences Act 2003 formally defined voyeurism (viewing or recording someone without consent for sexual gratification) as a criminal offense. These laws were a response to technology’s new capabilities – camcorders in purses, cellphones in locker rooms – but also a response to continued apologism that had hampered justice. Courts and legislators heard all too often the refrain that if images were taken surreptitiously and viewed privately, perhaps it was *“no harm, no foul.”* One hallmark of digital-era voyeurism apologism was the claim that if the victim never finds out, *what’s the problem?*

Consider an online discussion where a user struggles to “see the harm in deep fake pornography as long as people realize it’s fake.” Another commenter counters by describing the **shame and violation** victims feel, yet the first persists: *What if a deepfake (or hidden recording) is never public, only kept by the creator? If the subject is completely ignorant of it, is any harm done?*. This mentality – *“they don’t know, so it doesn’t hurt them”* – directly mirrors the mindset of the classic voyeur who thinks **sneaking a peek is harmless if he’s never caught**. In digital forums, some argued that the real harm lies only in distribution or reputational damage, not in the act of non-consensual capture or creation itself. Such hair-splitting justifications are essentially modern reboots of the age-old minimizations. They ignore the fundamental violation of autonomy and instead focus on **technicalities (awareness, publicity) to excuse the behavior**. Even when hidden-camera victims *did* find out – perhaps police informed them that their images were posted online – apologists would suggest that those victims were unharmed until that moment of discovery, shifting blame onto the *discovery* rather than the perpetrator’s initial act.

Despite these excuses, the real-world fallout for victims was severe. In South Korea, for instance, an epidemic of hidden spycam crimes (known as *molka*) saw **tens of thousands of women secretly filmed** in bathrooms, motels, etc. The images and videos were often uploaded to sordid websites where users paid to watch. Between 2013 and 2018, over 30,000 cases of illicit filming were reported to Korean police – a staggering figure that barely captures the trauma involved. Victims described the **psychological toll**: the paranoia of not knowing who watched you, the loss of a sense of safety even in solitary moments, and the humiliation that one’s intimate privacy became a stranger’s commodity. These are tangible harms that “no one was physically touched” utterly fails to account for. As one observer noted about the *molka* scourge, it had become *“a part of daily life”* for women to fear hidden cameras, yet enforcement lagged and perpetrators often got slaps on the wrist. This imbalance – rampant abuse vs. tepid accountability – was propped up by the same old cultural attitudes: trivializing the offense, and by extension, trivializing women’s rights to control their own image and space.

By the 2010s, it was clear that **voyeurism had entered the cyber age** with full force, dragging its apologetic baggage with it. When celebrities’ private nude photos were hacked and leaked (the 2014 “Fappening” incident), many online commentators blamed the victims for taking such photos at all, or shrugged it off because *“everyone was curious to see – it’s normal.”* Websites hosting stolen intimate images defended themselves as mere platforms, implicitly echoing *“if people want to peek, we just provide the keyhole.”* In these ways, the internet amplified both the *scale* of voyeuristic violations and the *chorus of excuses* accompanying them.
