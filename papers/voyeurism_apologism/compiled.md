# From Peeping Toms to Deepfakes: Tracing the Cultural History of Voyeurism Apologism into the Age of AI Sexploitation

*© Vova (Vladimir) Zakharov, 2025*

### **Abstract**

This paper examines the historical trajectory of voyeurism apologism and its direct ideological lineage to the modern defense of non-consensual deepfake pornography. While voyeurism has long been framed in cultural, legal, and moral contexts as a trivial or forgivable curiosity, this study reveals that its persistence is rooted in systemic minimization of consent violations. Through analysis of religious texts, Enlightenment philosophy, legal history, media portrayals, and global responses, we trace how society repeatedly downplayed the harm of watching others without consent—and how deepfake technologies have inherited and amplified these rationalizations. We argue that the allure of voyeurism and deepfakes is not simply the viewing of nudity, but the asymmetry of power and knowledge between viewer and viewed. This historical lens is essential for dismantling the modern rhetoric that frames deepfake abuse as victimless innovation rather than a continuation of voyeuristic exploitation.

### **Introduction**

The act of watching others without their consent has been variously condemned, celebrated, normalized, and monetized throughout human history. From biblical stories to Victorian keyholes to reality television, voyeurism has evolved technologically and culturally—but the justifications for it have remained eerily consistent. In this paper, we explore the historical patterns of **voyeurism apologism**—the rhetorical and social mechanisms used to downplay or excuse non-consensual watching—and demonstrate how these same patterns are now repackaged in defenses of **deepfake pornography**, particularly in its non-consensual forms.

The paper proceeds in seven sections, followed by a conclusion:

* **I. Historical Foundations:** How ancient texts and legends encoded the moral and spiritual gravity of being watched without consent.
* **II. Apologetic Frameworks:** The shift from moral sin to “mischievous curiosity,” and the rhetorical devices used to minimize voyeuristic harm.
* **III. Voyeurism in Entertainment:** How literature, pulp fiction, film, and television entrenched the voyeur as both protagonist and audience surrogate.
* **IV. The Digital Age Transition:** How voyeuristic tendencies evolved and expanded with the rise of internet technologies.
* **V. Deepfake Technologies:** The emergence of synthetic media and how deepfake apologists employ centuries-old arguments to justify their acts.
* **VI. Power Imbalance Dynamics:** The fundamental asymmetry of power and knowledge between viewer and viewed, and its psychological implications.
* **VII. Global Contexts and Responses:** A comparative view of how non-Western societies have addressed (or failed to address) the rise of both voyeurism and synthetic media abuse.

Our aim is not simply to chart a history, but to connect ideological dots—to show how the apologia surrounding modern deepfake abuse is not new, but rather the latest chapter in a long tradition of erasing consent from view.

### **Previous Work**

Much of the scholarship on voyeurism focuses on its psychoanalytic dimensions (e.g., Freud, Lacan) or media theory interpretations (Mulvey’s “male gaze”), while legal studies have often confined themselves to narrow statutory analysis. Recent scholarship has turned toward image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), including deepfake pornography, with work by McGlynn, Johnson, and Citron foregrounding its harms and the urgent need for regulation.

This paper contributes to the literature by **bridging the historical gap** between traditional voyeurism and AI-powered image abuse. While deepfakes have been examined in legal and ethical contexts, few studies have directly connected the **rhetorical continuity** between historical voyeurism apologism and modern defenses of synthetic non-consensual content. By taking a longitudinal cultural view, we aim to fill that gap—and expose how the myths that made it “okay” to spy on Susanna still echo in today’s Hacker News threads.

## From Ancient Religious Texts to 19th Century

Voyeuristic behavior – secretly observing someone without their consent – has been a source of moral shame for millennia. In Judeo-Christian tradition, such acts were often met with censure and punishment. An illustrative example comes from the **Book of Daniel**: the story of *Susanna and the Elders*. In this tale, two lecherous elders secretly watch the pious Susanna bathing in her private garden. When she spurns their advances, they falsely accuse her of adultery – a crime punishable by death. Ultimately, the truth comes out in court and Susanna is vindicated, while the voyeurs are punished for their misdeeds. The moral was clear: spying on an unwitting person was a grave wrongdoing associated with lust and dishonor. Likewise, in the **Book of Genesis**, Noah’s son Ham is castigated for *“seeing the nakedness of his father”* while Noah lay in a drunken sleep. Some interpretations hold that Ham’s sin was simple voyeurism – violating a taboo just by gawking at his father’s exposed state. Noah’s furious reaction (cursing Ham’s descendants) underscores how **early religious culture equated being an unwitting spectator to someone’s nudity with deep shame and moral transgression**.

Ancient mythology echoed similar themes. In Greek lore, when Actaeon accidentally glimpses the goddess Artemis bathing, her wrath is swift – she transforms him into a stag, and he is torn apart by his own hounds. The punishment may be mythic, but the message aligns with biblical sensibilities: *to pry into someone’s intimate space without consent is an affront deserving of retribution*. Even Israel’s revered King David faces dire consequences after indulging a voyeuristic impulse. Upon spotting Bathsheba bathing from his rooftop, David’s lust drives him first to voyeurism and then to a far worse abuse of power – a chain of events that the Bible portrays as his moral downfall. In sum, **early religious and mythic narratives frame voyeurism as a sinful “lust of the eyes,” an act bringing shame on both watcher and unwitting watched**. The onus of guilt lay squarely on the voyeur, who was expected to avert his eyes or face divine judgment. These teachings established a baseline: *to secretly observe someone in a state of undress or intimacy was not a trivial prank, but a violation of the natural and sacred order*.

### From Sin to “Curiosity”

Fast-forward to the Enlightenment and the 18th–19th centuries, and we see a gradual reframing of voyeurism in secular society. The age of Reason did not openly endorse prurient peeping – far from it – but a subtle shift occurred. Enlightenment thinkers placed high value on curiosity and empiricism; in certain circles, *“the curiosity of the gentleman observer”* became an intellectual virtue. This cultural backdrop meant that voyeuristic behavior, while still officially condemned by morals and law, could sometimes be downplayed as a *curious indiscretion* rather than a damnable sin. In libertine literature of the 1700s, for example, **peeking into private boudoirs was portrayed as titillating mischief** more than mortal offense. John Cleland’s *Fanny Hill* (1749), one of the first English erotic novels, contains scenes where the heroine secretly watches others in sexual acts – framing the voyeur’s gaze as a source of harmless pleasure and education in the ways of the world. Such stories, though scandalous, circulated widely, suggesting a nascent *apologetic framing of voyeurism as “natural curiosity.”*

At the same time, traditional opprobrium did not disappear. The very term **“Peeping Tom”** entered English lore via the legend of Lady Godiva. As the story goes, when Lady Godiva rode naked through Coventry to win tax relief for the town, all were ordered to shut their eyes. Only one man – Tom, a prying tailor – succumbed to voyeuristic temptation, drilling a hole in his shutter to spy on the nude noblewoman. His reward was immediate blindness (or death, in some versions) as divine punishment. This legend, though medieval in origin, was popularized in the 17th and 18th centuries and gave us the enduring label for a male voyeur. It reveals society’s conflicted view in this era: **on one hand, the *Peeping Tom* character was shamed and literally blinded as a warning; on the other, the very prevalence of the tale (and its later use in chocolates, poems, and paintings) kept alive a certain fascination with the “snoop” as a cultural figure**. In short, the Enlightenment and Victorian periods oscillated between condemnation and covert indulgence.

Legally, **prior to the 20th century there were few specific laws against voyeurism in Anglo-American jurisdictions**. Peeping was generally handled under vague notions of trespass or public nuisance, if at all. It wasn’t considered a serious criminal offense akin to rape or assault – after all, the thinking went, there was *“no physical contact”* and thus perhaps *“no real harm done.”* This attitude lingered in common law; a 19th-century jurist might have seen a peeper as a cad or trespasser, but not necessarily as a felon. As one legal scholar notes, voyeurism historically stood as an **odd exception** in the spectrum of sexual offenses – an invasion of privacy without physical touch that nevertheless was eventually criminalized despite the usual reluctance to treat non-contact acts as crimes. The reluctance itself speaks volumes: many in earlier eras instinctively downplayed the harm, implying that if no one was grabbed or raped, the offense lay more in impropriety than in injury. Under this view, the **victim’s suffering was often minimized**, and indeed the victim’s role could be perversely scrutinized – *had she been careful enough to shut the blinds?* In 1890, Warren and Brandeis published *“The Right to Privacy,”* partly spurred by the new menace of portable cameras and tabloid journalism. They decried the “unauthorized circulation of portraits of private persons” – an eloquent Victorian protest against nascent voyeurism via technology. Yet even as privacy began to be championed in principle, the *Peeping Tom* in practice was still sometimes laughed off as a naughty boy rather than a criminal. This period thus planted the seeds of a **long-running apologetic narrative**: voyeurism could be explained away as *curiosity, mischief, or a momentary lapse*, rather than recognized as a harmful power play.

## Voyeurism and the Victim: Perpetrators, Blame, and Sympathy

Across different eras, one constant was how society’s sympathy (or lack thereof) seesawed between the voyeur and the victim. In many traditional cultures, being watched without consent was profoundly humiliating – yet responses often failed to center the victim’s trauma. For example, in Victorian England, if a woman discovered a man spying through her bedroom window, she might suffer in silence to avoid social scandal (the *“ruined reputation”* fear), or she might even be chided for not ensuring her curtains were drawn. This echoes an insidious form of **victim-blaming**: implying the target *“assumed the risk”* of prying eyes by some perceived carelessness. Such reasoning persisted well into modern times. A legal analysis notes cases where courts debated whether a woman who left her blinds open had thereby *forfeited* her expectation of privacy – as if the onus was on her to preempt would-be voyeurs. Similarly, common discourse sometimes excused the peeper by painting the incident as a misunderstanding rather than a violation.

Meanwhile, perpetrators historically enjoyed a degree of social indulgence. The phrase **“boys will be boys”** captures this dismissive attitude. Peeping was often characterized as a prank of rambunctious youth or a *frolicsome indiscretion* of men “overcome by curiosity.” Even as recently as the late 20th century, one could hear a locker-room incident of secret filming brushed aside as *just boys being boys*. In one case, a county attorney lamented that many are quick to label video-voyeur incidents as a *“boys will be boys kind of prank,”* when in fact such crimes have severe legal and emotional consequences. This *minimization of the perpetrator’s culpability* – treating him as a mischievous lad rather than a violator – has long been a hallmark of voyeurism apologism. By contrast, victims historically received scant attention or were even ridiculed (in some 19th-century French farces, for instance, the woman being spied on is portrayed as the uptight foil to the adventurous peeping man). Essentially, **public discourse tended to trivialize the perpetrator’s actions (“harmless fun”) while marginalizing the victim’s hurt**, a dynamic that would later be mirrored in discussions about deepfake pornography.

Another apologetic framing was the invocation of **pathology or compulsion**. In the late 19th century, the nascent field of psychiatry began labeling extreme sexual behaviors as illnesses. *Voyeurism* (from the French *voir*, “to see”) was formally identified as a paraphilia by the 1890s. Medical texts and case studies portrayed some voyeurs as driven by irresistible compulsion – a sort of addiction to looking. This was a double-edged sword: on one hand, it stigmatized voyeurs as deviant (no longer just “mischievous boys” but potentially diseased minds), yet on the other, it offered a kind of excuse – *“he can’t help himself; he’s ill.”* In rare cases, defense lawyers even tried to use a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder to argue diminished responsibility (analogous to kleptomania as a defense for theft), though such tactics seldom succeeded in court. Still, the very attempt illustrates how **society groped for ways to soften blame on voyeurs** – casting them as hapless slaves to a compulsion or as objects of pity needing treatment, rather than as willful violators of others’ dignity.

## Voyeurism as Entertainment: From Literature to Pulp Fiction to Film

While morality and law wrestled with voyeurism, popular media was busy **normalizing the voyeur’s gaze** by turning it into a source of entertainment. In literature, the trope of the secret observer became commonplace. Eighteenth-century novels often included scenes of eavesdropping and peeping, allowing readers to vicariously enjoy forbidden sights. By the 19th century, illustrated magazines and penny dreadfuls capitalized on titillation. One could find pulpy stories of veiled ladies observed through keyholes, or scandalous *tableau* of aristocrats spying on each other’s affairs. This trend continued into the 20th century with pulp fiction and comics that weren’t shy about featuring scantily clad women on covers – implicitly inviting the (presumably male) reader to ogle alongside the illustrated **Peeping Tom**. In short, **media helped recast voyeurism from a solitary vice into a shared cultural spectacle**. The reader or viewer becomes *complicit in the voyeurism*, urged to identify with the one peeking rather than the one exposed. Such narratives gave voyeurism an aura of adventure and intrigue, sanding down its more predatory edges.

Cinema took this dynamic to new heights. In fact, film theory identifies voyeurism as central to the cinematic experience – the audience in a dark theater watching lives (and often bodies) on screen without those characters “knowing” they are watched. Classic Hollywood even turned voyeurism into high art and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock’s *Rear Window* (1954) is a prime example: the protagonist, laid up with a broken leg, obsessively spies on neighbors through his camera lens. The film invites us to sympathize with his curiosity. He’s *bored, he means no harm*, and ultimately he thwarts a crime – effectively redeeming his nosy behavior. The message: sometimes voyeurs are just good-natured sleuths or romantics at heart. A darker reflection came with Michael Powell’s *Peeping Tom* (1960), which portrayed a voyeuristic serial killer who films women’s fear; audiences recoiled and critics slammed the film, suggesting that an *unsanitized* look at voyeurism was too disturbing. Yet, over time, even **disturbing depictions contributed to normalizing the discussion** – the term “Peeping Tom” was by then so ingrained that a movie could simply use it as a title and expect everyone to understand the reference.

By the late 20th century, voyeur themes were ubiquitous. Slasher films often put the camera in the predator’s POV, forcing viewers into a voyeur’s perspective stalking victims. Comedies also played it for laughs – consider the infamous shower scene in *Porky’s* (1981) where teen boys drill holes in the girls’ locker room wall to watch them shower. The audience is meant to chuckle at the boys’ horny ingenuity and perhaps even envy them, while the girls’ humiliation is glossed over as comedic comeuppance (until, of course, a stern coach catches the boys in the act). **Such portrayals in mass media desensitized the public to the ethical violations of voyeurism, framing it as “naughty fun” rather than trauma**. Even literature and art took voyeurism as a given backdrop; art critics have noted that **the act of looking, often without consent, is deeply embedded in Western art** – from paintings of Susanna or Bathsheba (which invite the viewer to participate in the voyeur’s gaze) to modern photography. In sum, the media repeatedly presented scenarios in which *peeping* was either inconsequential or outright entertaining, reinforcing cultural apologetics that *as long as no one gets *physically* hurt, what’s the big deal?*

This normalization reached a crescendo with the rise of reality television and the voyeuristic turn of popular culture at the end of the 20th century. Shows like *Big Brother* literally made a spectacle of 24/7 surveillance, encouraging audiences to relish the role of voyeur into ordinary people’s private moments. Social critics observed that our culture had become “ever more voyeuristic,” treating invasive peeping not as deviance but as **prime-time entertainment and “guilty pleasure.”** As media scholar Clay Calvert noted around 2000, people now peep not through keyholes but via TV and internet screens – from tabloid talk shows to live police ride-alongs – absorbing others’ personal dramas for fun. Rather than stigmatize voyeurism, contemporary society repackaged it as a form of interactive amusement. In effect, technology democratized the voyeur’s gaze: anyone with a screen could *“peek”* into someone else’s life. This cultural shift dangerously blurs the line between consensual visibility and non-consensual violation, laying fertile groundwork for the deepfake era to come.

## The Digital Age: Hidden Cameras, Webcams, and Online Peeping

With the advent of inexpensive cameras and the internet in the late 20th century, voyeurism found new mediums and new excuses. Suddenly, the peeping Tom didn’t need a ladder and a keyhole – a mini camera or later a smartphone could do the trick. **Hidden camera incidents surged**: tiny lenses in dressing rooms, bathrooms, locker rooms, and shoe tips (for upskirt shots) became a worldwide plague. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the early web was littered with “voyeur” sites boasting clandestine footage. Some were semi-consensual (*JenniCam* famously live-streamed a young woman’s private life with her permission), but many were outright covert. It was the era of the “camgirl” but also of the **“web peeper.”** One notorious example occurred in 1998: a live-site claimed to show a college dorm room shower via a hidden cam, drawing millions of prurient hits until authorities intervened. In these nascent digital cases, perpetrators often fell back on old defenses in a new guise. “It’s just a prank,” “I was just curious,” or “everyone was doing it online” – such was the rhetoric, even as victims grappled with the knowledge that untold strangers had violated their privacy.

Legal systems scrambled to catch up. Lawmakers who had rarely dealt with peeping beyond local ordinances now faced the **age of “video voyeurs.”** By the early 2000s, a wave of legislation rolled out: the U.S. passed the federal Video Voyeurism Prevention Act in 2004, many states enacted specific anti-voyeurism statutes, and the UK’s Sexual Offences Act 2003 formally defined voyeurism (viewing or recording someone without consent for sexual gratification) as a criminal offense. These laws were a response to technology’s new capabilities – camcorders in purses, cellphones in locker rooms – but also a response to continued apologism that had hampered justice. Courts and legislators heard all too often the refrain that if images were taken surreptitiously and viewed privately, perhaps it was *“no harm, no foul.”* One hallmark of digital-era voyeurism apologism was the claim that if the victim never finds out, *what’s the problem?*

Consider an online discussion where a user struggles to “see the harm in deep fake pornography as long as people realize it’s fake.” Another commenter counters by describing the **shame and violation** victims feel, yet the first persists: *What if a deepfake (or hidden recording) is never public, only kept by the creator? If the subject is completely ignorant of it, is any harm done?*. This mentality – *“they don’t know, so it doesn’t hurt them”* – directly mirrors the mindset of the classic voyeur who thinks **sneaking a peek is harmless if he’s never caught**. In digital forums, some argued that the real harm lies only in distribution or reputational damage, not in the act of non-consensual capture or creation itself. Such hair-splitting justifications are essentially modern reboots of the age-old minimizations. They ignore the fundamental violation of autonomy and instead focus on **technicalities (awareness, publicity) to excuse the behavior**. Even when hidden-camera victims *did* find out – perhaps police informed them that their images were posted online – apologists would suggest that those victims were unharmed until that moment of discovery, shifting blame onto the *discovery* rather than the perpetrator’s initial act.

Despite these excuses, the real-world fallout for victims was severe. In South Korea, for instance, an epidemic of hidden spycam crimes (known as *molka*) saw **tens of thousands of women secretly filmed** in bathrooms, motels, etc. The images and videos were often uploaded to sordid websites where users paid to watch. Between 2013 and 2018, over 30,000 cases of illicit filming were reported to Korean police – a staggering figure that barely captures the trauma involved. Victims described the **psychological toll**: the paranoia of not knowing who watched you, the loss of a sense of safety even in solitary moments, and the humiliation that one’s intimate privacy became a stranger’s commodity. These are tangible harms that “no one was physically touched” utterly fails to account for. As one observer noted about the *molka* scourge, it had become *“a part of daily life”* for women to fear hidden cameras, yet enforcement lagged and perpetrators often got slaps on the wrist. This imbalance – rampant abuse vs. tepid accountability – was propped up by the same old cultural attitudes: trivializing the offense, and by extension, trivializing women’s rights to control their own image and space.

By the 2010s, it was clear that **voyeurism had entered the cyber age** with full force, dragging its apologetic baggage with it. When celebrities’ private nude photos were hacked and leaked (the 2014 “Fappening” incident), many online commentators blamed the victims for taking such photos at all, or shrugged it off because *“everyone was curious to see – it’s normal.”* Websites hosting stolen intimate images defended themselves as mere platforms, implicitly echoing *“if people want to peek, we just provide the keyhole.”* In these ways, the internet amplified both the *scale* of voyeuristic violations and the *chorus of excuses* accompanying them.

## Deepfakes: The New Face of Voyeurism

**Deepfakes** – AI-generated synthetic videos or images that swap a person’s likeness into footage they never actually participated in – emerged in the late 2010s as a potent new form of voyeuristic exploitation. Almost immediately, the technology was used to create fake pornography, almost always targeting women (often celebrities at first, and later private individuals). Like traditional voyeurism, deepfake porn involves viewing someone in sexual situations *without their consent*. The difference is that instead of *observing* a real event, the perpetrator is *fabricating* an event – but the goal is the same: to see (and share) an intimate image of a person who never agreed to be seen in that way. It didn’t take long for scholars and activists to point out the parallel. In 2024, legal experts dubbed deepfake sexual imagery the **“new voyeurism,”** arguing that creating a fake explicit image of someone *“is the new form of ‘taking’ intimate images without consent”* and should be treated legally akin to conventional voyeurism. In other words, the lack of *real* camera or *actual* peeping is a semantic distinction – morally and emotionally, the *effect on the victim* and the *intent of the perpetrator* align with age-old voyeurism.

What’s striking is how **the same rhetorical devices used to excuse old-school voyeurism have resurfaced to excuse deepfakes**. Below are some of the common apologetic refrains, unchanged in spirit despite the high-tech gloss:

* **“No Harm Done if No One Knows” – Privacy Is Intact Until Discovery:**  Just as voyeurs have long claimed their peeping hurts no one if the victim remains unaware, deepfake defenders argue that a privately created deepfake that isn’t widely circulated is *victimless*. They posit scenarios where an individual secretly makes a pornographic deepfake of someone *“for personal use only,”* suggesting that if the person depicted never finds out, then it’s as if nothing happened. This rationale willfully ignores the violation of consent that exists *regardless* of awareness. It also fails to consider the risk – as with any digital file – that the fake could later leak or be discovered. Nevertheless, the allure of the *“perfect crime”* (enjoying the image of someone without them ever knowing) remains a cornerstone of voyeuristic fantasy and is often used to downplay deepfakes: *It’s only a private fantasy, not a real assault*.

* **“It’s Just Fantasy / Curiosity – We All Wonder What So-and-So Looks Like”:**  Many deepfakes target famous actresses, singers, or even one’s own acquaintances. A common excuse is that these creations are merely an extension of *fantasy*. *Everyone imagines celebrities naked,* apologists say, *the deepfake is just an artistic (or technological) expression of that private fantasy*. This echoes historical apologetics where peeping was cast as *natural male curiosity*. During the Victorian era, some argued that adolescent boys peeping on bathing females were just acting out “healthy” curiosity about the opposite sex. Similarly, today’s defenders might say viewing an AI-generated nude of a classmate or co-worker is a form of “innocent” exploration – *a high-tech peep* that shouldn’t be conflated with physical harm. By labeling the act harmless fantasy, they seek to absolve themselves of the **power imbalance** at play (since the subject is not an equal participant in this “fantasy”).

* **“No Physical Contact, So It’s Not a Big Deal”:**  This is a direct carryover from how people diminished old voyeurism. Voyeurism and deepfakes are *“only images”* or *“only looking,”* not physical molestation – so, the argument goes, they should not be treated with the seriousness reserved for “real” sexual crimes. Indeed, voyeurs historically benefited from this false hierarchy, and deepfake creators attempt the same. However, modern legal thought is pushing back, noting that image-based sexual abuse can be deeply traumatic even without physical contact. Victims of deepfake porn often report feelings of **sexual violation and helplessness comparable to an assault**, because their likeness – an extension of their person – was used in a sexual way against their will. Nonetheless, the minimization persists in online debates: if it’s “just pixels” or “just code,” certain people insist it can’t be that harmful – a claim belied by the lived experiences of those targeted.

* **“She Shouldn’t Have Posted Pics / It’s Her Fault for Being Attractive”** (Victim-Blaming):  In a twist on the “assumed the risk” notion, some justify deepfakes by pointing to the images the victim *did* share. For example, if a young woman has selfies on her social media, deepfake creators feel *entitled* to those images as fodder. *She put them out there, I just used them.* This parallels blaming a voyeurism victim for, say, wearing revealing clothes or not covering her windows – *she made it too easy*. It’s a deeply entrenched apologetic tactic to shift responsibility from the violator to the victim’s mere existence or normal behavior. In South Korea’s *molka* debates, there have been instances of men claiming that women’s fashion (skirts, etc.) tempted voyeurs, an argument swiftly rejected by women’s rights groups as absurd. Yet with deepfakes, because the offending “material” is often innocuous photos that *the victim herself posted*, perpetrators latch onto that as a fig leaf of consent – which it absolutely is not. **Consent to share a normal photo is not consent to have one’s nude body fabricated**, but this nuance is lost on those determined to excuse their violations.

* **“Everyone Does It (Secretly)” & Peer Encouragement:**  On certain forums where non-consensual deepfakes are traded, there’s a sense of community that normalizes the practice. Users egg each other on, sharing tips and results, reinforcing the idea that *this is just a new hobby that lots of people do*. The behavior is cocooned in group affirmation. Historically, voyeurs also found camaraderie – the proverbial *boys’ club* where sharing stolen glances or illicit photos was met with high-fives instead of condemnation. This social normalization is a rhetorical strategy in that it reduces individual accountability: *if many are doing it, it can’t be that wrong – it’s society’s norm that’s changing.* Indeed, one of the dangers noted by ethicists is how deepfakes at scale could further **normalize the non-consensual consumption of someone’s intimate likeness**, making it seem routine.

It’s evident that **deepfake apologism is not novel** – it’s recycling scripts from the voyeur’s playbook. What’s novel is the *power and reach* of the technology. A 19th-century peeper could at most violate one person at a time and risk being seen; a deepfaker with minimal skill can potentially create explicit images of dozens of women and distribute them globally, all while remaining anonymous. The potential for scaled, anonymous abuse makes these apologetic narratives even more perilous. If believed, they could stall urgently needed interventions by painting deepfakes as *personal, harmless indulgences* rather than the far-reaching sexual violations they truly are. As law professor Clare McGlynn argues, **deepfake sexual abuse sits on the same continuum as voyeurism and other image-based sexual crimes** – it is part of *“the cultural scaffolding of rape culture,” undermining the boundaries of consent and normalizing violations in the digital age*. In plainer terms, each excuse for deepfakes borrows from a culture that long trivialized men’s invasive gaze, and in doing so, it props up a system in which (mostly) women’s consent can be overridden for (mostly) men’s pleasure.

## Power, Consent, and the Allure of Unawareness

Why is the lack of the subject’s awareness – the fact that the victim is unknowingly observed or depicted – so central to both voyeurism and deepfakes? The *allure of unawareness* lies at the heart of these acts. It creates a thrilling **imbalance of power**: the voyeur or deepfaker holds all the knowledge and control, while the subject is kept in the dark, reduced to a truly *objectified* object of desire. Psychologically, this dynamic is part of the turn-on for voyeurs. They are aroused not just by the nude body, but by the **one-sided power** of seeing without being seen, of having someone’s privacy in their hands. Psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl noted that even the “innocent” forms of voyeuristic looking are *“never value-free”* – they inherently involve *power, gender, and imbalance*. Voyeurism, he observed, connects the behavior of society’s worst offenders with the casual practices of its upstanding members. In other words, the same power imbalance that a criminal voyeur exploits is present, if subtler, when an average person derives pleasure from covertly watching or fantasizing without permission. The *imbalance itself* is the common denominator and is *“imbued”* with societal power dynamics (often male observer, female observed).

Deepfakes intensify this imbalance. The person making a deepfake wields a nearly god-like power over the victim’s likeness – they can **make someone “do” anything on camera** with zero consent. The victim’s unawareness is almost total; often women only learn deepfakes of them exist if they are leaked or if someone else tells them. This *invisible threat* hangs over all women, as McGlynn points out – any photo someone has shared could be weaponized without her knowledge. The perpetrator, meanwhile, delights in the fact that the target has *no idea* her face is being used for others’ gratification. It is the ultimate one-sided scenario. And as with classic voyeurism, some deepfake creators admit that if the real person *did* consent or perform willingly, it would “spoil” the excitement – the allure is precisely that she **has not given permission** and likely never would. The taboo of violating consent, ironically, becomes the spice of the act.

This is why both voyeurism and deepfake porn are often described in feminist critique as *a form of sexual entitlement and control*, rather than about sex per se. The voyeur and deepfaker take what they want (a view of the victim’s body, real or fabricated) without negotiation, denying the victim any agency. It reflects and reinforces a culture that historically treated women’s bodies as available for male use, with or without consent. Put simply, **consent is rendered irrelevant** by the voyeur’s logic. The crime (or sin) of voyeurism was never just that someone saw nudity; it was that they did so by *overriding the person’s will*. In deepfakes, this override is literal – technology overriding reality to produce a false image that ignores the victim’s lack of agreement.

Critically, the harm here is not only the end result (someone’s nude image circulating without permission) but the fundamental **denial of autonomy**. When an individual knows that others feel free to watch or simulate them sexually without consent, it has a chilling effect on personal freedom. Victims often report a feeling of *psychological bondage*: they can’t prove who has seen them or in what degrading scenarios their likeness might appear. This is akin to the way victims of stalking describe their loss of freedom – always looking over one’s shoulder. The *power imbalance* thus extends beyond the moment of voyeurism into the victim’s ongoing life, inducing self-censorship and fear. It’s a form of **social control** through humiliation.

From a societal perspective, tolerating these behaviors on the grounds of “harmlessness” sends a message that consent can be optional, something to be circumvented if one is clever enough (with a hidden cam or an AI model) not to get caught. It’s instructive to recall how long it took for “peeping Tom” behavior to be widely outlawed – for centuries it was dismissed with a wink. Only when technology made the invasions too numerous and egregious to ignore did laws stiffen. We are at a similar crossroads with deepfakes. As one commentator put it, the emergence of deepfake porn has shown that *“you can be made to appear in compromising, intimate situations without your consent”* – a violation that continues the long tradition of voyeuristic abuse, now turbo-charged by AI. The task now is to recognize it as such and not be lulled by the same old apologies.

## Global Perspectives: Voyeurism and Image Abuse Beyond the West

Though much of our focus has been on Western cultural history, other societies have grappled with voyeurism and related abuses in their own contexts. In **Japan**, voyeurism in modern times became so prevalent that it spawned its own disturbing sub-industry. The term *chikan* is often associated with groping on trains, but equally pernicious is *tosatsu* – secret photography of women (often upskirt shots). In the late 90s and early 2000s, as camera phones hit the market, incidents of men snapping illicit photos on subways and in stores exploded. The problem grew so notorious that Japanese phone manufacturers implemented a mandatory shutter sound on all phone cameras that can’t be muted – a technological fix meant to deter sneaky photographers. This was reinforced by legal measures: by 2015, laws explicitly banned silencing the camera shutter, aligning with privacy protection ordinances. A high-profile catalyst was the **Masashi Tashiro incident** in 2000. Tashiro, a former pop idol, was caught trying to film up a woman’s skirt with his cell phone and was arrested. The case shocked the public (and was actually one of several voyeurism-related arrests for Tashiro, whose career imploded amid these “peeping” crimes). The outcry helped spur the industry and lawmakers to ensure phones made a loud *click* – a rare instance of engineering to curb voyeurism at the source. Even so, cunning voyeurs adapted, using small standalone devices or devising apps to suppress the sound. Japan’s experience underscores how **deeply embedded voyeurism was in parts of the culture** – to the point that basic everyday tech had to be constrained to protect privacy.

Japan also has a well-documented market for illicit voyeur videos. For years, adult video stores (and later online sites) sold content labeled as “hidden camera” footage – sometimes actually staged, but often marketed as genuine spycam captures. This fetishization of non-consensual images created a feedback loop: high demand incentivized more covert filming. In recent years the Japanese government has tightened laws against such distribution, and police periodically bust rings of hidden cam producers. Yet the **apologetic framing** persists in some quarters. Consumers tell themselves the videos are victimless if the women’s faces are blurred (ignoring that the women never agreed to be filmed at all). The act of watching someone who “doesn’t know they’re being watched” is fetishized, not seen as criminal. Culturally, Japan has had to reckon with this, balancing a historical norm of strict public modesty against an underground reality of voyeuristic exploits.

Moving to **South Korea**, as mentioned, the country has faced what officials call a *spycam epidemic*. Tiny cameras in motel rooms, public toilets, school dorms – virtually nowhere has been off-limits. By the mid-2010s, tens of thousands of cases were being reported, and women took to the streets in mass protests. In 2018, around 22,000 women marched in Seoul holding signs like “My Life is Not Your Porn”. They demanded tougher penalties and an end to the pervasive normalization of these crimes. Part of what they were fighting is precisely *voyeurism apologism*: for too long, many Korean men (and some authorities) treated spycam antics as a pesky byproduct of the digital age or *“a part of daily life”* that one must tolerate. President Moon Jae-in acknowledged the problem and pushed for action, and indeed punishments have increased, though activists say enforcement still has far to go. In South Korea’s case, there is also a **digital vigilante element**: women began sweeping public bathrooms for hidden lenses, a practice born out of necessity. That such measures are needed speaks to how deeply the *it’s just for fun* or *for male camaraderie* mindset had taken root among perpetrators. Only sustained public pressure has started to shift the narrative toward *“this is a serious sex crime.”* Additionally, South Korea saw instances of *deepfake-like abuse* early on – e.g., celebrities’ faces pasted on porn images, or private individuals’ faces used in app-generated nudes – prompting the government to include synthetic media in its definition of illegal porn distribution. In 2021, the country amended laws to explicitly criminalize making or sharing sexual images synthesized without consent, a move ahead of many Western countries.

Other non-Western societies have their own angles. In India, for example, *voyeurism* was explicitly added as a criminal offense in the Penal Code in 2013 (after a notorious gangrape case prompted a broad overhaul of sexual offense laws). Indian law now punishes anyone who watches or captures images of a woman engaging in a private act, if done without consent, recognizing the humiliation it causes. This came after numerous hidden cam scandals – from spycams in changing rooms to the circulation of an MMS clip of two consenting adults that was leaked and went viral, ruining the woman’s life. Traditionally, South Asian cultures strongly emphasize female modesty, so voyeurism often results in severe social consequences for the woman (victim) – a dynamic that doubly victimizes her. Nonetheless, the legal reforms indicate progress in seeing the act itself as the crime, not the state of the woman’s dress or behavior.

In the Middle East, strict morality laws would ostensibly make voyeurism a grave sin (and indeed, if caught, a voyeur could face harsh punishment or street justice). Yet, anecdotally, the segregation of genders and difficulty of dating in some of these countries can fuel a different kind of voyeurism – men may resort to peeping for sexual gratification in societies where contact between unmarried men and women is forbidden. This again can be tacitly excused as an outlet for natural urges in an unnatural social setting. Thus, even where religious law uncompromisingly forbids it, the *apologetic narrative* finds a way when societal conditions drive the behavior underground.

What emerges from these global snapshots is that **voyeurism – and its modern digital manifestations – is a universal challenge**, but cultures vary in their response. Some East Asian societies have been forced by sheer volume of incidents to publicly confront and condemn the practice (e.g. large public awareness campaigns in Korea, technology mandates in Japan). Others are just beginning to discuss it. Everywhere, however, a common thread is visible: the struggle to move past *“harmless”* or *inevitable* characterizations and to recognize the real harm to those whose privacy and dignity are stolen.

## Conclusion: From Voyeur to Deepfaker – Breaking the Apologia Cycle

Tracing the evolution of voyeurism apologism from biblical times to the age of AI reveals a sobering pattern. Time and again, advances in technology or shifts in cultural milieu have given voyeurs new ways to intrude on privacy – from the Renaissance keyhole to the Kodak camera, from the camcorder to the deepfake generator. And each time, society’s initial response has tended to lag, mired in old biases: *boys will be boys*, *it’s only natural curiosity*, *no harm if no one’s hurt*. The parallels between secret peepers of yesteryear and deepfake creators today are uncanny – not because the acts are identical in method, but because the **justifications sound like echoes across centuries**. Both depend on a willful blindness to the importance of consent. Both downplay the power imbalance at play. Both often shift blame to the victim or to abstract societal forces, rather than the individual choice to violate someone’s privacy.

Yet, history also shows an arc (albeit a slow one) bending toward accountability. What was once written off as *scandalous mischief* eventually came to be seen as a breach of fundamental rights. We see this in the gradual strengthening of voyeurism laws and the increasingly widespread recognition that image-based abuses cause real trauma. In the discourse on AI ethics and tech accountability, deepfakes have become a key concern, and rightly so. They force us to confront questions that are not actually new: Will we allow new technology to become an excuse for old abuses? Will we accept a culture where anyone’s likeness can be seized for entertainment, echoing the era when peeping Toms skated by because their crime was invisible and chuckle-worthy? Or will we apply the hard-earned lessons of the past? Those lessons tell us that **we must put consent and dignity at the center**, and expose apologetic tropes for what they are – attempts to permit cruelty under the guise of normalcy.

In pushing back against deepfake apologism, we are in effect finishing the work of pushing back against voyeurism apologism. It is a continuation of the same struggle in a new theater. The conversation is admittedly complex: it touches on free expression, the nature of “reality” in media, and even artistic license. But certain points admit no ambiguity: **non-consensual sexual depiction is a violation**, be it through a keyhole or through code. The person who perpetrates it is not a folk hero of curiosity or a harmless prankster; he (or she) is treading on someone’s autonomy. And the person subjected to it is not oversensitive for feeling violated; they stand in a line of victims from Susanna onward who have every right to cry foul and demand justice.

Ultimately, shining a light on these historical and cultural evolutions arms us with understanding. It allows us to *name* the old excuses when we hear them in new packaging. The next time someone shrugs off deepfake porn as just inevitable “boys being boys with tech,” we can recall how that same excuse was used to ignore women’s pleas about peepers in fitting rooms – and we can remind them that society decided such behavior was unacceptable. The trajectory of voyeurism apologism teaches that **cultural attitudes can change**. What was once “provocative but not dry” titillation in a pulp magazine can become recognized as an abusive invasion in court. Likewise, the more we draw these parallels in public discourse – making it clear that deepfakes are part of an ongoing story of voyeuristic abuse – the harder it will be for apologists to hide behind pseudo-innocuous rhetoric.

In the end, holding **tech accountable** for how it enables abuse goes hand in hand with holding *people* accountable for how they use it. The camera, the internet, the algorithm – none are inherently evil, but all have been tools for those who seek the illicit thrill of seeing without being seen. It falls to society to remove the cloak of permissiveness that has too often shrouded the voyeurs. By learning from the past – from that ancient garden in Babylon where elders ogled Susanna, to the Victorian keyhole, to the pixelated faces on a fake video – we can better craft laws, norms, and technologies that affirm one simple principle: **there is nothing “harmless” about violating someone’s consent, no matter how cleverly or quietly it’s done**. And when we, as a culture, fully embrace that principle, the apologias that have excused voyeurism in all its guises will finally ring hollow.
