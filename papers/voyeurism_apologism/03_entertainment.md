## Voyeurism as Entertainment: From Literature to Pulp Fiction to Film

While morality and law wrestled with voyeurism, popular media was busy **normalizing the voyeur’s gaze** by turning it into a source of entertainment. In literature, the trope of the secret observer became commonplace. Eighteenth-century novels often included scenes of eavesdropping and peeping, allowing readers to vicariously enjoy forbidden sights. By the 19th century, illustrated magazines and penny dreadfuls capitalized on titillation. One could find pulpy stories of veiled ladies observed through keyholes, or scandalous *tableau* of aristocrats spying on each other’s affairs. This trend continued into the 20th century with pulp fiction and comics that weren’t shy about featuring scantily clad women on covers – implicitly inviting the (presumably male) reader to ogle alongside the illustrated **Peeping Tom**. In short, **media helped recast voyeurism from a solitary vice into a shared cultural spectacle**. The reader or viewer becomes *complicit in the voyeurism*, urged to identify with the one peeking rather than the one exposed. Such narratives gave voyeurism an aura of adventure and intrigue, sanding down its more predatory edges.

Cinema took this dynamic to new heights. In fact, film theory identifies voyeurism as central to the cinematic experience – the audience in a dark theater watching lives (and often bodies) on screen without those characters “knowing” they are watched. Classic Hollywood even turned voyeurism into high art and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock’s *Rear Window* (1954) is a prime example: the protagonist, laid up with a broken leg, obsessively spies on neighbors through his camera lens. The film invites us to sympathize with his curiosity. He’s *bored, he means no harm*, and ultimately he thwarts a crime – effectively redeeming his nosy behavior. The message: sometimes voyeurs are just good-natured sleuths or romantics at heart. A darker reflection came with Michael Powell’s *Peeping Tom* (1960), which portrayed a voyeuristic serial killer who films women’s fear; audiences recoiled and critics slammed the film, suggesting that an *unsanitized* look at voyeurism was too disturbing. Yet, over time, even **disturbing depictions contributed to normalizing the discussion** – the term “Peeping Tom” was by then so ingrained that a movie could simply use it as a title and expect everyone to understand the reference.

By the late 20th century, voyeur themes were ubiquitous. Slasher films often put the camera in the predator’s POV, forcing viewers into a voyeur’s perspective stalking victims. Comedies also played it for laughs – consider the infamous shower scene in *Porky’s* (1981) where teen boys drill holes in the girls’ locker room wall to watch them shower. The audience is meant to chuckle at the boys’ horny ingenuity and perhaps even envy them, while the girls’ humiliation is glossed over as comedic comeuppance (until, of course, a stern coach catches the boys in the act). **Such portrayals in mass media desensitized the public to the ethical violations of voyeurism, framing it as “naughty fun” rather than trauma**. Even literature and art took voyeurism as a given backdrop; art critics have noted that **the act of looking, often without consent, is deeply embedded in Western art** – from paintings of Susanna or Bathsheba (which invite the viewer to participate in the voyeur’s gaze) to modern photography. In sum, the media repeatedly presented scenarios in which *peeping* was either inconsequential or outright entertaining, reinforcing cultural apologetics that *as long as no one gets *physically* hurt, what’s the big deal?*

This normalization reached a crescendo with the rise of reality television and the voyeuristic turn of popular culture at the end of the 20th century. Shows like *Big Brother* literally made a spectacle of 24/7 surveillance, encouraging audiences to relish the role of voyeur into ordinary people’s private moments. Social critics observed that our culture had become “ever more voyeuristic,” treating invasive peeping not as deviance but as **prime-time entertainment and “guilty pleasure.”** As media scholar Clay Calvert noted around 2000, people now peep not through keyholes but via TV and internet screens – from tabloid talk shows to live police ride-alongs – absorbing others’ personal dramas for fun. Rather than stigmatize voyeurism, contemporary society repackaged it as a form of interactive amusement. In effect, technology democratized the voyeur’s gaze: anyone with a screen could *“peek”* into someone else’s life. This cultural shift dangerously blurs the line between consensual visibility and non-consensual violation, laying fertile groundwork for the deepfake era to come.
