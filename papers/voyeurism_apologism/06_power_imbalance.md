## Power, Consent, and the Allure of Unawareness

Why is the lack of the subject’s awareness – the fact that the victim is unknowingly observed or depicted – so central to both voyeurism and deepfakes? The *allure of unawareness* lies at the heart of these acts. It creates a thrilling **imbalance of power**: the voyeur or deepfaker holds all the knowledge and control, while the subject is kept in the dark, reduced to a truly *objectified* object of desire. Psychologically, this dynamic is part of the turn-on for voyeurs. They are aroused not just by the nude body, but by the **one-sided power** of seeing without being seen, of having someone’s privacy in their hands. Psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl noted that even the “innocent” forms of voyeuristic looking are *“never value-free”* – they inherently involve *power, gender, and imbalance*. Voyeurism, he observed, connects the behavior of society’s worst offenders with the casual practices of its upstanding members. In other words, the same power imbalance that a criminal voyeur exploits is present, if subtler, when an average person derives pleasure from covertly watching or fantasizing without permission. The *imbalance itself* is the common denominator and is *“imbued”* with societal power dynamics (often male observer, female observed).

Deepfakes intensify this imbalance. The person making a deepfake wields a nearly god-like power over the victim’s likeness – they can **make someone “do” anything on camera** with zero consent. The victim’s unawareness is almost total; often women only learn deepfakes of them exist if they are leaked or if someone else tells them. This *invisible threat* hangs over all women, as McGlynn points out – any photo someone has shared could be weaponized without her knowledge. The perpetrator, meanwhile, delights in the fact that the target has *no idea* her face is being used for others’ gratification. It is the ultimate one-sided scenario. And as with classic voyeurism, some deepfake creators admit that if the real person *did* consent or perform willingly, it would “spoil” the excitement – the allure is precisely that she **has not given permission** and likely never would. The taboo of violating consent, ironically, becomes the spice of the act.

This is why both voyeurism and deepfake porn are often described in feminist critique as *a form of sexual entitlement and control*, rather than about sex per se. The voyeur and deepfaker take what they want (a view of the victim’s body, real or fabricated) without negotiation, denying the victim any agency. It reflects and reinforces a culture that historically treated women’s bodies as available for male use, with or without consent. Put simply, **consent is rendered irrelevant** by the voyeur’s logic. The crime (or sin) of voyeurism was never just that someone saw nudity; it was that they did so by *overriding the person’s will*. In deepfakes, this override is literal – technology overriding reality to produce a false image that ignores the victim’s lack of agreement.

Critically, the harm here is not only the end result (someone’s nude image circulating without permission) but the fundamental **denial of autonomy**. When an individual knows that others feel free to watch or simulate them sexually without consent, it has a chilling effect on personal freedom. Victims often report a feeling of *psychological bondage*: they can’t prove who has seen them or in what degrading scenarios their likeness might appear. This is akin to the way victims of stalking describe their loss of freedom – always looking over one’s shoulder. The *power imbalance* thus extends beyond the moment of voyeurism into the victim’s ongoing life, inducing self-censorship and fear. It’s a form of **social control** through humiliation.

From a societal perspective, tolerating these behaviors on the grounds of “harmlessness” sends a message that consent can be optional, something to be circumvented if one is clever enough (with a hidden cam or an AI model) not to get caught. It’s instructive to recall how long it took for “peeping Tom” behavior to be widely outlawed – for centuries it was dismissed with a wink. Only when technology made the invasions too numerous and egregious to ignore did laws stiffen. We are at a similar crossroads with deepfakes. As one commentator put it, the emergence of deepfake porn has shown that *“you can be made to appear in compromising, intimate situations without your consent”* – a violation that continues the long tradition of voyeuristic abuse, now turbo-charged by AI. The task now is to recognize it as such and not be lulled by the same old apologies.

## Global Perspectives: Voyeurism and Image Abuse Beyond the West

Though much of our focus has been on Western cultural history, other societies have grappled with voyeurism and related abuses in their own contexts. In **Japan**, voyeurism in modern times became so prevalent that it spawned its own disturbing sub-industry. The term *chikan* is often associated with groping on trains, but equally pernicious is *tosatsu* – secret photography of women (often upskirt shots). In the late 90s and early 2000s, as camera phones hit the market, incidents of men snapping illicit photos on subways and in stores exploded. The problem grew so notorious that Japanese phone manufacturers implemented a mandatory shutter sound on all phone cameras that can’t be muted – a technological fix meant to deter sneaky photographers. This was reinforced by legal measures: by 2015, laws explicitly banned silencing the camera shutter, aligning with privacy protection ordinances. A high-profile catalyst was the **Masashi Tashiro incident** in 2000. Tashiro, a former pop idol, was caught trying to film up a woman’s skirt with his cell phone and was arrested. The case shocked the public (and was actually one of several voyeurism-related arrests for Tashiro, whose career imploded amid these “peeping” crimes). The outcry helped spur the industry and lawmakers to ensure phones made a loud *click* – a rare instance of engineering to curb voyeurism at the source. Even so, cunning voyeurs adapted, using small standalone devices or devising apps to suppress the sound. Japan’s experience underscores how **deeply embedded voyeurism was in parts of the culture** – to the point that basic everyday tech had to be constrained to protect privacy.

Japan also has a well-documented market for illicit voyeur videos. For years, adult video stores (and later online sites) sold content labeled as “hidden camera” footage – sometimes actually staged, but often marketed as genuine spycam captures. This fetishization of non-consensual images created a feedback loop: high demand incentivized more covert filming. In recent years the Japanese government has tightened laws against such distribution, and police periodically bust rings of hidden cam producers. Yet the **apologetic framing** persists in some quarters. Consumers tell themselves the videos are victimless if the women’s faces are blurred (ignoring that the women never agreed to be filmed at all). The act of watching someone who “doesn’t know they’re being watched” is fetishized, not seen as criminal. Culturally, Japan has had to reckon with this, balancing a historical norm of strict public modesty against an underground reality of voyeuristic exploits.

Moving to **South Korea**, as mentioned, the country has faced what officials call a *spycam epidemic*. Tiny cameras in motel rooms, public toilets, school dorms – virtually nowhere has been off-limits. By the mid-2010s, tens of thousands of cases were being reported, and women took to the streets in mass protests. In 2018, around 22,000 women marched in Seoul holding signs like “My Life is Not Your Porn”. They demanded tougher penalties and an end to the pervasive normalization of these crimes. Part of what they were fighting is precisely *voyeurism apologism*: for too long, many Korean men (and some authorities) treated spycam antics as a pesky byproduct of the digital age or *“a part of daily life”* that one must tolerate. President Moon Jae-in acknowledged the problem and pushed for action, and indeed punishments have increased, though activists say enforcement still has far to go. In South Korea’s case, there is also a **digital vigilante element**: women began sweeping public bathrooms for hidden lenses, a practice born out of necessity. That such measures are needed speaks to how deeply the *it’s just for fun* or *for male camaraderie* mindset had taken root among perpetrators. Only sustained public pressure has started to shift the narrative toward *“this is a serious sex crime.”* Additionally, South Korea saw instances of *deepfake-like abuse* early on – e.g., celebrities’ faces pasted on porn images, or private individuals’ faces used in app-generated nudes – prompting the government to include synthetic media in its definition of illegal porn distribution. In 2021, the country amended laws to explicitly criminalize making or sharing sexual images synthesized without consent, a move ahead of many Western countries.

Other non-Western societies have their own angles. In India, for example, *voyeurism* was explicitly added as a criminal offense in the Penal Code in 2013 (after a notorious gangrape case prompted a broad overhaul of sexual offense laws). Indian law now punishes anyone who watches or captures images of a woman engaging in a private act, if done without consent, recognizing the humiliation it causes. This came after numerous hidden cam scandals – from spycams in changing rooms to the circulation of an MMS clip of two consenting adults that was leaked and went viral, ruining the woman’s life. Traditionally, South Asian cultures strongly emphasize female modesty, so voyeurism often results in severe social consequences for the woman (victim) – a dynamic that doubly victimizes her. Nonetheless, the legal reforms indicate progress in seeing the act itself as the crime, not the state of the woman’s dress or behavior.

In the Middle East, strict morality laws would ostensibly make voyeurism a grave sin (and indeed, if caught, a voyeur could face harsh punishment or street justice). Yet, anecdotally, the segregation of genders and difficulty of dating in some of these countries can fuel a different kind of voyeurism – men may resort to peeping for sexual gratification in societies where contact between unmarried men and women is forbidden. This again can be tacitly excused as an outlet for natural urges in an unnatural social setting. Thus, even where religious law uncompromisingly forbids it, the *apologetic narrative* finds a way when societal conditions drive the behavior underground.

What emerges from these global snapshots is that **voyeurism – and its modern digital manifestations – is a universal challenge**, but cultures vary in their response. Some East Asian societies have been forced by sheer volume of incidents to publicly confront and condemn the practice (e.g. large public awareness campaigns in Korea, technology mandates in Japan). Others are just beginning to discuss it. Everywhere, however, a common thread is visible: the struggle to move past *“harmless”* or *inevitable* characterizations and to recognize the real harm to those whose privacy and dignity are stolen.

## Conclusion: From Voyeur to Deepfaker – Breaking the Apologia Cycle

Tracing the evolution of voyeurism apologism from biblical times to the age of AI reveals a sobering pattern. Time and again, advances in technology or shifts in cultural milieu have given voyeurs new ways to intrude on privacy – from the Renaissance keyhole to the Kodak camera, from the camcorder to the deepfake generator. And each time, society’s initial response has tended to lag, mired in old biases: *boys will be boys*, *it’s only natural curiosity*, *no harm if no one’s hurt*. The parallels between secret peepers of yesteryear and deepfake creators today are uncanny – not because the acts are identical in method, but because the **justifications sound like echoes across centuries**. Both depend on a willful blindness to the importance of consent. Both downplay the power imbalance at play. Both often shift blame to the victim or to abstract societal forces, rather than the individual choice to violate someone’s privacy.

Yet, history also shows an arc (albeit a slow one) bending toward accountability. What was once written off as *scandalous mischief* eventually came to be seen as a breach of fundamental rights. We see this in the gradual strengthening of voyeurism laws and the increasingly widespread recognition that image-based abuses cause real trauma. In the discourse on AI ethics and tech accountability, deepfakes have become a key concern, and rightly so. They force us to confront questions that are not actually new: Will we allow new technology to become an excuse for old abuses? Will we accept a culture where anyone’s likeness can be seized for entertainment, echoing the era when peeping Toms skated by because their crime was invisible and chuckle-worthy? Or will we apply the hard-earned lessons of the past? Those lessons tell us that **we must put consent and dignity at the center**, and expose apologetic tropes for what they are – attempts to permit cruelty under the guise of normalcy.

In pushing back against deepfake apologism, we are in effect finishing the work of pushing back against voyeurism apologism. It is a continuation of the same struggle in a new theater. The conversation is admittedly complex: it touches on free expression, the nature of “reality” in media, and even artistic license. But certain points admit no ambiguity: **non-consensual sexual depiction is a violation**, be it through a keyhole or through code. The person who perpetrates it is not a folk hero of curiosity or a harmless prankster; he (or she) is treading on someone’s autonomy. And the person subjected to it is not oversensitive for feeling violated; they stand in a line of victims from Susanna onward who have every right to cry foul and demand justice.

Ultimately, shining a light on these historical and cultural evolutions arms us with understanding. It allows us to *name* the old excuses when we hear them in new packaging. The next time someone shrugs off deepfake porn as just inevitable “boys being boys with tech,” we can recall how that same excuse was used to ignore women’s pleas about peepers in fitting rooms – and we can remind them that society decided such behavior was unacceptable. The trajectory of voyeurism apologism teaches that **cultural attitudes can change**. What was once “provocative but not dry” titillation in a pulp magazine can become recognized as an abusive invasion in court. Likewise, the more we draw these parallels in public discourse – making it clear that deepfakes are part of an ongoing story of voyeuristic abuse – the harder it will be for apologists to hide behind pseudo-innocuous rhetoric.

In the end, holding **tech accountable** for how it enables abuse goes hand in hand with holding *people* accountable for how they use it. The camera, the internet, the algorithm – none are inherently evil, but all have been tools for those who seek the illicit thrill of seeing without being seen. It falls to society to remove the cloak of permissiveness that has too often shrouded the voyeurs. By learning from the past – from that ancient garden in Babylon where elders ogled Susanna, to the Victorian keyhole, to the pixelated faces on a fake video – we can better craft laws, norms, and technologies that affirm one simple principle: **there is nothing “harmless” about violating someone’s consent, no matter how cleverly or quietly it’s done**. And when we, as a culture, fully embrace that principle, the apologias that have excused voyeurism in all its guises will finally ring hollow.
