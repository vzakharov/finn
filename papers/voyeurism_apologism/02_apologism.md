## Voyeurism and the Victim: Perpetrators, Blame, and Sympathy

Across different eras, one constant was how society’s sympathy (or lack thereof) seesawed between the voyeur and the victim. In many traditional cultures, being watched without consent was profoundly humiliating – yet responses often failed to center the victim’s trauma. For example, in Victorian England, if a woman discovered a man spying through her bedroom window, she might suffer in silence to avoid social scandal (the *“ruined reputation”* fear), or she might even be chided for not ensuring her curtains were drawn. This echoes an insidious form of **victim-blaming**: implying the target *“assumed the risk”* of prying eyes by some perceived carelessness. Such reasoning persisted well into modern times. A legal analysis notes cases where courts debated whether a woman who left her blinds open had thereby *forfeited* her expectation of privacy – as if the onus was on her to preempt would-be voyeurs. Similarly, common discourse sometimes excused the peeper by painting the incident as a misunderstanding rather than a violation.

Meanwhile, perpetrators historically enjoyed a degree of social indulgence. The phrase **“boys will be boys”** captures this dismissive attitude. Peeping was often characterized as a prank of rambunctious youth or a *frolicsome indiscretion* of men “overcome by curiosity.” Even as recently as the late 20th century, one could hear a locker-room incident of secret filming brushed aside as *just boys being boys*. In one case, a county attorney lamented that many are quick to label video-voyeur incidents as a *“boys will be boys kind of prank,”* when in fact such crimes have severe legal and emotional consequences. This *minimization of the perpetrator’s culpability* – treating him as a mischievous lad rather than a violator – has long been a hallmark of voyeurism apologism. By contrast, victims historically received scant attention or were even ridiculed (in some 19th-century French farces, for instance, the woman being spied on is portrayed as the uptight foil to the adventurous peeping man). Essentially, **public discourse tended to trivialize the perpetrator’s actions (“harmless fun”) while marginalizing the victim’s hurt**, a dynamic that would later be mirrored in discussions about deepfake pornography.

Another apologetic framing was the invocation of **pathology or compulsion**. In the late 19th century, the nascent field of psychiatry began labeling extreme sexual behaviors as illnesses. *Voyeurism* (from the French *voir*, “to see”) was formally identified as a paraphilia by the 1890s. Medical texts and case studies portrayed some voyeurs as driven by irresistible compulsion – a sort of addiction to looking. This was a double-edged sword: on one hand, it stigmatized voyeurs as deviant (no longer just “mischievous boys” but potentially diseased minds), yet on the other, it offered a kind of excuse – *“he can’t help himself; he’s ill.”* In rare cases, defense lawyers even tried to use a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder to argue diminished responsibility (analogous to kleptomania as a defense for theft), though such tactics seldom succeeded in court. Still, the very attempt illustrates how **society groped for ways to soften blame on voyeurs** – casting them as hapless slaves to a compulsion or as objects of pity needing treatment, rather than as willful violators of others’ dignity.
