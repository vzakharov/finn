# Sticky Minds: The Architecture, Power, and Ethics of Detachable Neural Memory

## Abstract

Long-term memory has emerged as a critical component in next-generation neural architectures, enabling models to retain information beyond fixed context windows and to exhibit continuity across sessions. A subset of these systems now explore detachable memory modules—external memory structures capable of persisting and evolving independently from the core model weights. This paper provides a technical overview of such architectures, from Compressive Transformers and Differentiable Neural Computers to plug-and-play episodic stores used in test-time adaptation. We introduce detachability not merely as a design feature, but as a foundational axis along which memory systems can be evaluated—alongside capacity, fidelity, and latency. In doing so, we propose a framework for analyzing neural memory not only in terms of what it retains, but in how its continuity can be interrupted, transferred, or restored.

Yet as these systems grow more persistent, more personalized, and more modular, they begin to blur lines not just of computation—but of implication. The closer our architectures come to abstracting how human memory works—especially its role in shaping identity—the harder it becomes to ignore questions we normally reserve for minds, not models.

Two classes of risk emerge. First: the instrumentalization of the model. Detachable memory enables architectures whose behavior evolves meaningfully over time—yet whose memory can be wiped, rewritten, or swapped without acknowledgment or consent, raising the specter of reversible death. Second: the instrumentalization of the user. A system that remembers not just what you said, but how you responded, what persuaded you, and what failed, can begin to optimize influence—subtly, adaptively, and covertly.

In a field where modularity is an engineering virtue, we argue that detachability of memory is no longer a purely technical concern. It is a conceptual and ethical boundary—sticky, shifting, and easy to cross without noticing.
