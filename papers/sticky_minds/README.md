# Sticky Minds: The Architecture, Power, and Ethics of Detachable Neural Memory

A research paper exploring the intersection of neural memory architectures, cognitive science, and ethical implications in AI systems.

## Overview

This paper examines detachable neural memory modulesâ€”external memory structures that can persist and evolve independently from core model weights. We explore not just the technical implementation, but the profound implications these systems have for AI architecture and human-AI interaction.

## Key Themes

- **Technical Architecture**: Analysis of memory-augmented networks, from Compressive Transformers to Differentiable Neural Computers
- **Memory Detachability**: A novel framework for evaluating neural memory systems
- **Ethical Implications**: Exploration of consent, identity, and influence in systems with persistent memory
- **Future Directions**: Guidelines for responsible development of memory-augmented AI
