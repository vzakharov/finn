# “Neural Databases”: A Quick Overview

Here’s the quick rundown: “neural database” isn’t a single product but an umbrella label for at least three research and product streams—memory-augmented nets that use neural “memories,” schema-less query engines built on transformers, and AI startups branding their advanced vector indexes as databases. Across these you’ll find prototypes, papers, and even live services—all calling themselves “neural databases.”

## 1. Memory as a neural database

Neural memory architectures like Memory Networks and Neural Turing Machines implement read/write mechanisms that let a model store past activations in an external or fast-weight “memory,” effectively acting like a tiny, neural-powered database of recent context ([Википедия][1], [cs229.stanford.edu][2]).

## 2. Neural networks as databases

Projects such as NeuralDB envision storing data as natural-language facts and using transformer-based query operators instead of SQL and schemas. These systems can answer select-project-join style queries purely through learned NLP primitives ([arXiv][3], [vldb.org][4]).

## 3. AI-powered indexing: vector & “neural” databases

Startups like ThirdAI dub their next-gen retrieval engines “neural databases.” They replace conventional indexing with learned index structures that map embeddings to items, speeding up similarity search at scale ([Medium][5], [Medium][6]).

## 4. Specialized variants & frontier research

There are niche offshoots—neural databases tailored for differentially private spatial queries, neural planners that optimize join orders, and more—showing the term’s broad, evolving usage ([vldb.org][7], [openproceedings.org][8]).

## So—is it a thing?

Yes: “neural database” is very much a thing, just not one monolithic technology. It’s a lively research area and a branding trend for systems that blur the line between neural nets and data storage/query engines ([arXiv][3], [Medium][5]).
