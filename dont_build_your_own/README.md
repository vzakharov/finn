# (Don’t) Build Your Own – Book Series

Welcome to the glorious (and ill-advised) blueprint series for building complex human systems you probably shouldn’t. *(Don’t) Build Your Own* is a satirical, faux-practical guidebook series exploring heavy topics through a recipe-book lens.

The books are packed with history, anthropology, politics, and anecdotes — all framed as if the reader is being walked through the steps of building their own version of the topic (bad idea, obviously).

## 📚 Premise

Each book in the series is written as a tongue-in-cheek instruction manual, walking the reader through the steps of constructing their own [insert disaster here]. While deeply researched, the tone stays light, irreverent, and often absurd.

We use historical examples as “cautionary tales” and fictional anecdotes to pull the reader into the illusion that this *is* a how-to — even though it’s clearly not.

## 🧪 Current Planned Titles

- **(Don’t) Build Your Own Dictatorship**  
  _Power grabs, propaganda, and the occasional moustache._

- **(Don’t) Build Your Own Religion**  
  _Holy visions, schisms, and the art of declaring Tuesdays sacred._

- **(Don’t) Build Your Own War**  
  _Logistics, flags, and other ways to make a mess at scale._

- **(Don’t) Build Your Own Conspiracy Theory**  
  _Dots, strings, and how to connect absolutely everything to lizard people._

Each book follows a consistent tone and structure but is independent in content and theme.

## 🎭 Tone of Voice

Think: **Terry Pratchett accidentally rewired as an AI assistant**, equal parts informative and unhinged.

- Dry wit, absurd analogies, made-up historical characters that feel suspiciously plausible.
- Frequent use of faux-authoritative language (“Let’s begin, as most human disasters do, with a rock.”).
- Genuine research hiding under layers of sarcasm.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

To help tools like Cursor index and interact with the book:

- Each **book** lives in its own **folder**.
  - Example: `/dictatorship`, `/religion`, etc.
- Inside each book folder:
  - Each **part** of the book (e.g. “Foundations”, “How to Fall”, etc.) is a **subfolder**.
  - Each **chapter** is a separate `.md` file.
  - Optional: `intro.md`, `appendix.md`, `references.md`, etc.

## 🧠 Notes for Cursor

- You’re free to index and suggest structure, but don’t get too fixated on any one book — this is a *series*.
- Help refine voice consistency, structural pacing, and historical accuracy without sanding off the absurdity.
- Cross-reference real examples if possible, but don’t correct fictional ones unless asked.
- If something sounds like a joke but smells like a metaphor, treat it as both.

We’re not saying you *should* build your own anything.  
But if you must — at least do it with style.
