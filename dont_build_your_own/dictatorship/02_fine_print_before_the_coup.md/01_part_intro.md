# **Part 0: Baby Steps: Warming Up to the Boots’ March**

*Because every aspiring tyrant needs to study the ancient masters of oppression*

Trying to find *the first* dictatorship is a bit like trying to find *the first* sandwich. It probably wasn’t called that yet, and the recipe involved more blood than bread, but the core ingredients were already there: hunger, opportunity, and someone slower than you.

Unlike democracy — that fragile flower requiring rules, votes, and an unspoken agreement not to stab each other — dictatorship is, at first glance, gloriously low-maintenance. No consensus, no committees, just a healthy sense of entitlement and something sharp. It’s governance at its most instinctive. Some people like to say that democracy is the natural state of humankind. Those people have clearly never met humankind.

But don’t be fooled into thinking it's all just bonks and bravado. True dictatorship — the kind that survives, thrives, and gets its own official holiday — requires more than blunt force. It demands finesse, vision, and the rare ability to make “unanimous consent” sound like it wasn’t obtained at gunpoint. Anyone can yell, “I’m in charge!” — only the successful ones get monuments built before the peasants wise up.

So instead of asking who the first dictator was — which is like trying to find the first shadow in a world before candles — ask: who was the first *good* one? Good in the worst way, of course — ruthless, theatrical, and just savvy enough to rewrite history while they were still alive. The kind of person who didn't just steal power but made it look inevitable.

That's the kind of dictatorship we're here to study. Not Og on a hill — charming fellow, but hopeless at messaging — but the one who carved their legacy into stone, wrapped it in a myth, and dared the future to forget them.

Spoiler: the future didn't.
