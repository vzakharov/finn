# **Introduction**

*Where sticks become scepters (until they don’t)*

Let’s begin, as many regrettable ideas do, with a stick.

Somewhere on the squishy edge of prehistory, long before treaties and power suits, there was Og. Og was not especially strong, nor especially clever, but Og did have a very loud voice and a surprisingly heavy stick. One day, Og climbed a hill, declared himself Chief of Everything, and hit Thog on the head before anyone could vote on it. Thus was born the first dictatorship.

Naturally, Og’s rule was short-lived (Thog recovered, and, as it turns out, had a bigger stick), but the idea stuck. Across the millennia, humans would return again and again to Og’s basic innovation: *Why share power when you can just take it and declare it divine?*

This book is for anyone who’s looked at history’s worst ideas and thought, “Yes, but what if I did it *better*?” It’s a cookbook for autocrats, a DIY for despotism, a manual for megalomaniacs who want to skip the small talk and get straight to the golden statues.

But — and this is important — it’s also a mirror. Because while the moustaches and flags change, the ingredients rarely do. And if we understand the recipe, we’re a little less likely to swallow the soup next time.

So sharpen your tongue, dust off your propaganda machine, and whatever you do — don’t let the generals read this before you’re done.

Power awaits.

And if you stick with us, you just might survive it.
