## **Chapter II: The First Franchise**

*In which Sargon scales tyranny, humiliates rivals, and introduces the fiscal year of obliteration*

If Narmer was the prototype — a one-mace show who united Egypt by smashing heads and calling it divine order — Sargon of Akkad was the rollout. The expansion pack. The empire-as-a-service model.

Around 2334 BCE, Sargon rose from his humble beginnings as a cupbearer — essentially Mesopotamia’s middle-management bartender — to launch history’s first known multinational dictatorship. No gods descended to anoint him. No noble lineage paved his way. He just took it. One city at a time. And then made a business model out of it.

### The Hostile Takeover of Kish

The opening pitch of Sargon’s career was, in modern terms, a coup-slash-merger. Legend says he began as a servant in the court of Ur-Zababa, king of Kish. One day — possibly after a poorly poured drink — Sargon staged a palace coup and took the throne. From there, he rapidly moved from local power to regional menace, conquering Uruk and parading its defeated king, Lugalzagesi, through the sacred gate of Enlil *on a leash*.

Let’s pause here. Leading your rival by a collar through a major temple isn’t just a victory lap. It’s a PowerPoint presentation in human form. It’s Sargon saying, “I own your gods now.”

### Wash Your Weapons in the Sea

Over the next few decades, Sargon built an empire that stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. And he did it with repeatable strategy: conquer city, destroy its walls, rename the year after the act, move on.

This is not metaphor. Akkadian bureaucrats actually named years after atrocities. “The Year I Burned Mari.” “The Year I Besieged Elam (Again).” Imagine filing your taxes during “The Year Dad Got Marched Through the Temple in Chains.”

He boasted that “5,400 men eat daily at my table,” which was either the region’s first professional standing army or an extremely aggressive dinner party. He washed his weapons in the sea, which is what you do when you’ve run out of cities to sack on land.

### The Bureaucratized Bludgeon

Sargon didn’t just conquer. He installed governors (handpicked yes-men), enforced Akkadian as the lingua franca, and introduced standardized weights, measures, and record-keeping. He also mandated that all tribute come directly to him — no middlemen, no local elites. Just pure top-down autocracy.

He also introduced an imperial dating system. Instead of “Year 3 of Sargon,” you got “Year in which Sargon razed X and made its elders cry.” Each atrocity got notarized, archived, and remembered. It was violence with a filing cabinet. Narmer made fear sacred; Sargon made it scalable.

### Dictator? No. Dictator-as-a-Service? Absolutely.

Sargon didn’t call himself a dictator — there was no such title in 24th century BCE Mesopotamia. But he called himself *“king of the world”* and *“king of the four corners of the universe,”* which is the sort of thing only people with zero checks and balances tend to say out loud.

His empire ran on three things:

* **Force** — lots of it.
* **Bureaucracy** — the invisible whip.
* **Narrative control** — because if you name the year, you write the story.

And while his empire eventually crumbled — like all good franchises do — Sargon gave us the blueprint:

> > **Decentralize the violence, centralize the glory.**
> > **Appoint loyal regional enforcers.**
> > **Raze, record, repeat.**

If Narmer was the birth of dictatorship, Sargon was the first to turn it into a business plan.
