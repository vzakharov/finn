# **Hard Times, Strong Men, and Other Convenient Memes**

*Why the macho cycle of civilizational collapse falls apart faster than the societies it claims to explain*

You’ve seen it. Maybe even reposted it. That smug little ouroboros of doom:

> *Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times.*

It’s the “Circle of Life” for guys who think Genghis Khan had the right idea, minus the hygiene. It shows up in TikToks with Roman statues, in tweets complaining about oat milk, and in the subtext of every TED Talk titled *“Why We Need Leaders Who Lift.”*

And on the surface, it’s tidy. Poetic, even. There’s a rhythm, a sense of historical inevitability, a comforting moral about toughness. But here’s the thing: **it’s mostly ahistorical, selectively remembered, and rhetorically loaded to hell.**

This is the Glitchporn guide to debunking the Macho Cycle of Civilizational Collapse.

## **Ancient Wisdom with More Filter Effects?**

*Spoiler: It does not come from Marcus Aurelius, despite what the TikTok voiceover says.*

Before we get into historical rebuttals, let’s be clear about what this thing is not: it’s not ancient Stoic wisdom, it wasn’t found in some lost Spartan group chat, and it’s definitely not how actual historians talk. The first known version of the full meme comes from a 2016 post-apocalyptic novel by G. Michael Hopf—yes, fiction—who admits he was riffing on generational theory. That theory, by the way, comes from Strauss and Howe’s *Fourth Turning*, which is basically what you’d get if you handed a mood ring to a demographer.

But credit where it’s due: the meme is a hell of a soundbite. It compresses all of history into a single moral loop, conveniently assigning blame (*weak men*), prescribing salvation (*strong men*), and giving us all a tidy excuse for why the world feels like it’s going to hell (*we’re just at that part of the cycle, bro*).

This is why it spread like wildfire. It’s not just pithy—it’s emotionally flattering. If you believe the world is in “hard times,” then, by definition, you must be a “strong man” enduring it. If things seem chaotic, it’s not your fault—it’s the “weak men” before you who caused it. It’s not just a meme; it’s a secular theodicy for the terminally aggrieved.

And that’s where it gets dangerous. Because once you buy into the cycle, you stop questioning it. You start cheering for “strong” leaders—whatever that means—assuming they’re the natural antidote. You start seeing softness, complexity, even kindness as symptoms of decay. And worst of all, you might start treating history like a gym mirror: something that only reflects your own flexing back at you.

## **A Handy List of “Actually, No”s**

*A cheatsheet for the next time an Andrew Tate acolyte crashes into your DMs with Roman statue memes.*

History’s messy. The meme isn’t. All it takes is a few well-placed counterexamples to watch the whole thing unravel. Here’s your debunking arsenal—organized by each smug little link in the chain:

### **Hard times create strong men**

(*i.e., suffering breeds saviors*)

* 🇯🇵 **Post-WWII Japan** (1945–1952): Nuked, occupied, devastated—and [rebuilt by pacifist technocrats](https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/Japan-since-1945), not warrior-kings.
* 🇸🇪 **Sweden’s Famine & Reform Era** (1867–69): Crop failures and hunger didn’t bring generals—just [expanded voting rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1866_Swedish_general_election).
* 🇨🇦 **Great Depression Canada** (1930s): [Bank failures, mass unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_Canada), little to no fascists. Parliamentary democracy held.

### **Strong men create good times**

(*i.e., authoritarianism fixes everything*)

* 🇩🇪 **Nazi Germany** (1933–1945): [Militarized, centralized, mythologized](https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/The-Third-Reich-1933-45). Ended in rubble and genocide.
* 🇰🇭 **Khmer Rouge Cambodia** (1975–79): [Peasant-worshipping strongmen](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Khmer-Rouge) emptied the cities and filled the graves.
* 🇲🇽 **Aztec Empire under Montezuma II** (1502–1520): Militaristic, theocratic, brutal—and [collapsed like wet obsidian](https://www.britannica.com/summary/Decline-of-the-Aztec-Empire).

### **Good times create weak men**

(*i.e., prosperity makes you soft*)

* 🇨🇳 **Tang Dynasty China** (7th–9th c.): [Trade boomed, poetry flourished](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tang-dynasty)—and generals still [kicked ass on the steppe](https://www.britannica.com/place/China/Rise-of-the-empress-Wuhou).
* 🇮🇹 **Renaissance Florence** (15th c.): Wealth, art, and banking didn’t stop them from [plotting, dueling, and occasionally assassinating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazzi_conspiracy) their way through power struggles.
* 🇮🇶 **Abbasid Caliphate** (8th–9th c.): [Science, medicine, bureaucracy](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bayt-al-Hikmah)—somehow no one melted into decadence.

### **Weak men create hard times**

(*i.e., softness causes collapse*)

* 🇳🇱 **Dutch Golden Age** (17th c.): [Ruled by merchants, tolerant](https://www.britannica.com/place/Netherlands/Dutch-civilization-in-the-Golden-Age-1609-1713), and relatively pacifist—somehow no one collapsed from all the trade and paintings.
* 🇬🇧 **Victorian Britain** (late 19th c.): Between [fainting couches and moral panic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/crime_01.shtml), they still [built railroads on five continents](https://www.britannica.com/event/British-raj).
* 🇪🇹 **Zemene Mesafint Ethiopia** (1769–1855): [Politically fragmented, emperors sidelined](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zamana-Masafent)—but the [imperial system endured](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tewodros-II) just fine.

## **Where the Meme Snaps (and Where It Clings Like a Tick)**

Now that we’ve seen the cracks, let’s talk about the strength of each link—not in macho terms, but in terms of how well they actually hold up when you, you know, open a history book.

Somewhat alarmingly, the hardest part to debunk is the very first:
**“Hard times create strong men.”**
This one clings. Not because it predicts nobility or virtue, but because it taps into something darker and truer: when a society hits the rocks, people get desperate. And desperation is prime ground for manipulation. You don’t necessarily get strength—you get opportunists, demagogues, cult leaders, and occasionally someone who just looks good yelling on horseback. The “strength” that arises from suffering is usually concentrated, brutal, and self-serving. It’s not a phoenix; it’s a vulture with good PR.

On the other end, **“strong men create good times”** is the meme’s most fragile fantasy. Honestly, we’d have a much harder time finding a *supporting* example than a refutation. Even the usual suspects crumble under inspection. **Napoleon?** Sure, if you count “good times” as nonstop war, continental conscription, and a legacy that got France invaded three times in a century. **Julius Caesar?** His rise ended the Republic and kicked off a century of purges and imperial bloodletting. **Genghis Khan?** Great for Mongol logistics; less great for the 11% of humans who stopped existing. Even when it *looks* like strength brought stability, it usually came soaked in violence, repression, or sheer unsustainability.

The middle bits—**“good times create weak men”** and **“weak men create hard times”**—are more slippery. They stick because they sound plausible, but history doesn’t commit to them. Some prosperous societies do get weird and decadent. Others build universities, infrastructure, and lasting institutions while sipping wine and wearing lace. Some so-called “weak” leaders preside over calm, productive eras. Others really do steer straight into disaster. There’s no clean pattern—just vibes and hindsight.

So what we’re left with is a meme that’s most “true” in its bleakest corner: the idea that suffering breeds authoritarian appeal. And that’s not wisdom—it’s a warning. The rest? Rhetoric. A tidy little loop drawn by people who’d like you to stop thinking and start obeying.

## **Beware the Convenience**

The meme works because it *feels* like insight. It rhymes with history, vaguely resembles a pattern, and offers a kind of grim comfort: we’re just at *that* part of the cycle. But tidy loops like this aren’t insight—they’re shortcuts. And like most shortcuts, they get you lost the moment you stop checking the map.

The real danger isn’t that it’s entirely wrong—it’s that it’s **just plausible enough** to stop you from questioning it. Once you buy in, everything starts to look like part of the script: good times become suspicious, nuance looks like weakness, and complexity becomes a moral failing. You don’t need evidence—you just need to know what phase we’re in.

That’s not how history works. It glitches, it stumbles, it changes its mind. And when we try to smooth it into a cycle that always ends in heroics and collapse, we’re not predicting the future—we’re rehearsing it.

So show them what it leaves out. Then ask what it’s trying to sell.

**Not every pattern is insight. Some are just flexes that belong in the locker room, not the history books.**
