# Counterexamples to the “Strong Men” meme (part 2)

Here’s the skinny: prosperity so often gets a bad rap for breeding “weak men,” and softness for inviting collapse, but history shows the opposite—rich, cultured societies kept their edge, and eras of hand‑wringing hardly upended empires.

## **Good times create weak men**

### 🇨🇳 Tang Dynasty China (7th–9th c.)

Despite unparalleled prosperity—evidenced by a flourishing network of market towns and a Golden Age of poetry (nearly 50,000 works from 2,000 poets survive) ([Encyclopedia Britannica][1], [Encyclopedia Britannica][2])—and robust military campaigns that subdued the western Turks and conquered Koguryŏ (including the capture of Pyongyang in 668) ([Encyclopedia Britannica][3]), the Tang maintained both cultural refinement and martial dominance.

### 🇮🇹 Renaissance Florence (15th c.)

Wealth from banking and commerce fueled Florence’s artistic ascendancy—Medici “rose chiefly by their intelligent use of wealth derived from commerce and banking” and patronized masters for over a century ([Britannica Kids][4], [Encyclopedia Britannica][5])—yet political power plays remained lethal, from vendettas to the 1478 Pazzi Conspiracy and endemic dueling ([Wikipedia][6], [Cambridge University Press & Assessment][7]).

### 🇮🇶 Abbasid Caliphate (8th–9th c.)

Under the early Abbasids, Baghdad’s House of Wisdom became a hub for science and medicine, translating and advancing Greek learning ([Encyclopedia Britannica][8], [Encyclopedia Britannica][9]), while Sasanian administrative traditions were woven into a sophisticated bureaucracy that kept the empire humming rather than rotting in decadence ([Encyclopedia Britannica][10]).

## **Weak men create hard times**

### 🇳🇱 Dutch Golden Age (17th c.)

The Dutch Republic, governed by merchant‑patricians whose fortunes lay in trade and finance ([Encyclopedia Britannica][11]), fostered arguably Europe’s most vibrant cultural flowering without succumbing to political collapse—prosperity and painting powered on unabated even as tolerance prevailed ([Encyclopedia Britannica][12], [Encyclopedia Britannica][13]).

### 🇬🇧 Victorian Britain (late 19th c.)

Amid Victorian moral panics—over garrotting, Ripper‑style murders, and more ([BBC][14])—Britain and its empire still spun out rail networks at breakneck speed, laying some 8,000 miles at home by 1850 and exporting steel‑tracked lines to India (5,000 miles by 1869) and beyond ([Britannica Kids][15], [Encyclopedia Britannica][16]).

### 🇪🇹 Zemene Mesafint Ethiopia (1769–1855)

During Ethiopia’s “Age of the Princes,” regional warlords throttled the Solomonic line—leaving emperors as figureheads in a feudal anarchy ([Encyclopedia Britannica][17])—yet the imperial institution survived intact, only to be reunified under Tewodros II in 1855 ([Encyclopedia Britannica][18], [Encyclopedia Britannica][19]).
