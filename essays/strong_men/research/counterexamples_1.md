# Counterexamples to the “Strong Men” meme (part 1)

Here’s the cheat‑sheet with solid backing for each “Actually, no”:

A quick spin through history shows that calamity rarely births the benevolent strongman the meme promises—often it’s civilian reformers or democratic grit (or, well, outright catastrophe) that carry the day.

## **Hard times create strong men**

### 🇯🇵 Post‑WWII Japan (1945–1952)

Reconstruction was driven by civilian oversight—land reform, industrial policy, and a pacifist constitution (Article 9) rather than any new warrior‑kings. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][1], [Wikipedia][2])

### 🇸🇪 Sweden’s Famine & Reform Era (1867–69)

The last great Northern European famine (1867–69) devastated the countryside, but instead of generals stepping in, Sweden moved to a new bicameral system with extended (census‑based) male suffrage in the 1866 election. ([Wikipedia][3], [Wikipedia][4])

### 🇨🇦 Great Depression Canada (1930s)

Canada weathered bank failures, mass unemployment, and the “Dirty Thirties” via social‑welfare innovations and maintained parliamentary democracy—fringe fascist groups were later banned at the outbreak of WWII. ([Wikipedia][5], [Wikipedia][6])

## **Strong men create good times**

### 🇩🇪 Nazi Germany (1933–1945)

Hitler’s totalitarian regime centralized power, militarized the state, and engineered genocide—only to end in utter collapse and Allied occupation. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][7], [Encyclopedia Britannica][8])

### 🇰🇭 Khmer Rouge Cambodia (1975–1979)

Under Pol Pot’s agrarian utopia, cities were emptied and 1.5–3 million people perished in the Cambodian genocide. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][9], [Encyclopedia Britannica][10])

### 🇲🇽 Aztec Empire under Montezuma II (1502–1520)

A theocratic, militaristic state extracting tribute and human sacrifices collapsed abruptly when Cortés and his allies besieged Tenochtitlán in 1521. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][11], [Encyclopedia Britannica][12])
