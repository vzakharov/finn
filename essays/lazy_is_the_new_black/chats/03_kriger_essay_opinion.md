## Summary

Boris (Bruce) Kriger’s essay, “The Relationship Between Boredom and Laziness: A Paradox of Human Motivation,” published in Clinical Research News on October 13, 2024, argues that while boredom signals a lack of engagement that people instinctively avoid, laziness—often demonized—can be strategically embraced to spur innovation through efficiency and mental rest, creating a surprising symbiosis between these two states ([Medium][1]).

## Publication Info

* First appearing on Medium under the Clinical Research News banner on October 13, 2024, the piece reaches a wide readership interested in the psychological underpinnings of motivation ([Medium][1]).

## What Makes It Contrarian?

### 1. Reframing Laziness as Productive

* **Against the grain on sloth:** Kriger flips the standard view of laziness from a moral failing into a driver of labor-saving innovations—think washing machines or smartphones, each born from a desire to reduce effort and boost results ([Medium][1]).
* **Creativity via inaction:** He points out that “lazy” breaks engage the brain’s default mode network, fostering the mental recombination of ideas that leads to eureka moments ([Medium][1]).

### 2. Paradoxical Relationship with Boredom

* **Boredom as signal, not sin:** Although boredom is widely feared as an empty void, Kriger shows it also serves as a catalyst for seeking meaningful engagement rather than mere distraction ([Medium][1]); contemporary experts note that boredom, when harnessed, can kick-start genuine creativity instead of just mindless scrolling ([The Guardian][2]).
* **Craving laziness amid boredom aversion:** He highlights the oddity that people dread boredom yet simultaneously chase laziness for its restorative and efficiency-boosting perks—upending the usual assumption that laziness is simply detrimental ([Medium][1]).

### 3. Challenging Cultural Stigma

* **Rest is righteous:** By arguing that strategic laziness can improve well-being and output, Kriger confronts the deep-rooted cultural narrative that glorifies nonstop productivity and shames downtime ([Medium][1]).
* **Aligning with modern psychology:** His stance aligns with recent findings that breaks and periods of low effort aren’t just indulgences but essential for problem-solving and innovation ([The Guardian][2]).

## Conclusion

Yes—in reframing laziness as a creative ally and boredom as a motivational beacon, Kriger’s essay clearly adopts a contrarian stance, challenging mainstream views that label both states as purely negative and instead positioning them as complementary forces in human motivation and innovation ([Medium][1]).
