# Lazy is the New Black, or How to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Prompt

## Misdirected brilliance with a low boredom threshold

For centuries, laziness has had a branding problem. It’s been lumped in with moral failure, teenage angst, and that one colleague who always has "a migraine" when deadlines loom.

But let’s be honest: Most so-called “lazy” people aren’t uninterested in doing *something*; they’re just uninterested in doing *that*. The boring stuff. The spreadsheet wrangling. The mindless form-filling. The third status update this week.

Contrary to your inner schoolteacher’s warnings, laziness isn’t a character flaw. It’s a kind of feral intelligence. A quiet rebellion against the tyranny of pointless effort. As any bored genius will tell you, true laziness is just brilliance that refuses to be wasted on tedium.

As quoted by philosopher Boris Kriger in his delightfully contrarian [essay](https://medium.com/clinical-research-news/the-relationship-between-boredom-and-laziness-a-paradox-of-human-motivation-b72d082b9059), Douglas Hofstadter wrote that laziness *“drives innovation by prompting people to design tools, processes, and systems that reduce the effort needed to complete tasks.”* This is the quietly muttered battle cry of the lazy genius: “I don’t want to do it, so I’ll make it do itself.”

And it turns out science backs this up. A study published in the *Journal of Health Psychology* (as retold by Scotty Hendricks over at Big Think) found that individuals with a high “need for cognition”—people who enjoy thinking—tend to be less physically active. Not because they’re lazy in the couch-potato sense, but because they’re more mentally engaged. Sometimes, they’re just more content to sit still and chew ideas like mental cud.

Lazy? Or just preoccupied with higher-order problems like the metaphysics of dishwasher loading? You decide.

## An outsourcing intern for the creatively lazy

Enter AI — the glorious unpaid intern with unlimited patience and questionable judgment. For those of us who’ve always treated tasks as dragons to be delegated rather than slain, AI is less of a revolution and more of a long-awaited relief.

Here’s a hot take that’ll get you uninvited from LinkedIn panels: AI isn’t here to replace you. It’s here to stop you from having to write another useless summary email at 5:47 p.m. on a Thursday. It’s not gunning for your job—it’s eyeing your to-do list like a golden retriever eyeing a tennis ball.

Where some see threats, the cleverly lazy see tools. AI doesn’t have to replace you—it can just *relieve* you. Of the tedious, the repetitive, the "ugh do I really have to write this email again?" parts of the job. The kind of stuff that should have been replaced with magic long ago, but HR was against summoning.

AI does the boring parts fast. And as Ethan Mollick points out, in tasks like business writing, it can cut down time by 40% *and* improve quality. People get their time back—and maybe their souls, too. (Bonus: "After using it, people were more worried about their jobs… but also significantly happier – why? Because a lot of work is boring, and AI did the boring stuff fast.")

We’re not building robots to take over. We’re building assistants to hold the clipboard while we invent the next thing to offload. The creatively lazy among us have simply found a new accomplice. The folks who already know how to offload crap work are living their best lives right now. They’ve seen this movie before. It’s just a newer cast.

## Scripting was the old lazy; prompting is the new lazy

Once upon a time, the creatively lazy wrote scripts to escape repetition. Macros in Excel. Bash aliases. Chrome extensions that autoclose annoying tabs. The tools varied, but the spirit remained the same: “I shouldn’t have to do this twice.”

What’s changed is the interface. We’re not writing `for i in range(10):` anymore. We’re typing: *“Summarize this 20-page doc in pirate voice and sort the action points by urgency.”* And the machine listens.

This isn’t new; it’s just more accessible. As Ethan Mollick puts it, in his characteristically dry academic enthusiasm,"Automation has always been about eliminating work that is repetitive, and often dangerous or boring." What was once the province of code nerds in basements is now playground material for marketers, project managers, and your Aunt Susan who still double-spaces after periods.

Prompts are just scripts in a tuxedo. Or maybe a hoodie. Point is, they’re dressed for the occasion.

## The throne belongs to the cunning delegator

So, who thrives in this new world? The ones who understand delegation — not just to people, but to algorithms. The ones who know how to break down tasks, hand them off, and only swoop in for quality control like a manager with style and a calendar full of "thinking time."

Here’s where it gets spicy: you don’t even need to *do* the thing anymore — you just need to be the person who knows *what* should be done and *how* to offload it. The new power move isn’t hustle. It’s judgment. Can you tell what should be done by you, and what should be punted to the bots? Can you steer the intern who never sleeps, never unionizes, and never asks for a raise? Welcome to your empire.

As Bernard Marr puts it, *"Artificial intelligence isn’t going to replace people — but people who use AI are going to replace people who don’t."* That’s not career advice. That’s a weather report. The rain is falling, and the umbrella is called *delegation*.

Think of the lazy third son in every folktale. The one who doesn’t fight the dragon but chats with the talking bird who knows a shortcut. Delegation is their secret sauce. It’s not about doing the work. It’s about making sure the work gets done — with a bit of strategic idleness. (And yes, that son is almost always called “the fool” — but hey, we talked about branding problems earlier.)

Learning how to delegate to AI — when to trust it, when to double-check it, and how to phrase your request — is the 2025 equivalent of knowing how to send an email in 1997. Fail to adapt, and you’ll be the office equivalent of a fax machine.

## So, what now?

Stop whining. Start prompting. You don’t need to become a tech wizard. You just need to think like one of those early scripters, but in prose.

If you’re already inclined to offload tedious work, congrats — you’re halfway to mastering AI delegation. If you're still clutching your to-do list like a badge of honor, maybe it's time to look up, squint at the future, and think: what would a lazy genius do?

Probably nothing. But they’d get a bot to do something *very* useful.
