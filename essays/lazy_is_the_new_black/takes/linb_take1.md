# Lazy is the New Black, or How to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Prompt

## Laziness isn’t sloth; it’s misdirected brilliance with a low boredom threshold

Contrary to your inner schoolteacher’s warnings, laziness isn’t a character flaw. It’s a kind of feral intelligence. A quiet rebellion against the tyranny of pointless effort. As Douglas Hofstadter once suggested (as quoted in Boris Kriger’s delightfully contrarian essay), laziness "drives innovation by prompting people to design tools, processes, and systems that reduce the effort needed to complete tasks."

Translation? People weren’t too lazy to do the work. They were too smart to suffer through doing it the hard way.

This isn’t just poetic defiance—it’s science. A study published in the *Journal of Health Psychology* and cheerily disseminated by Scotty Hendricks over at *Big Think* found that people with a high "Need for Cognition" (NFC)—those who actually enjoy thinking—tend to be more physically inactive. Not because they’re slugs, but because they’re more content to sit still and chew ideas like mental cud. Lazy? Or just preoccupied with higher-order problems like the metaphysics of dishwasher loading? You decide.

## AI isn’t a job-stealer, it’s an outsourcing intern for the creatively lazy

Here’s a hot take that’ll get you uninvited from LinkedIn panels: AI isn’t here to replace you. It’s here to stop you from having to write another useless summary email at 5:47 p.m. on a Thursday. It’s not gunning for your job—it’s eyeing your to-do list like a golden retriever eyeing a tennis ball.

This moment in tech history isn’t about losing work. It’s about shedding the 40% of your job that’s secretly soul-eroding nonsense. As Ethan Mollick observed in *In Praise of Boring AI*, when ChatGPT was tasked with business writing, users finished 40% faster and delivered work that outsiders actually rated 18% better. But here’s the kicker: "After using it, people were more worried about their jobs… but also significantly happier – why? Because a lot of work is boring, and AI did the boring stuff fast."

Let’s put it bluntly: the folks who already know how to offload crap work are living their best lives right now. They’ve seen this movie before. It’s just a newer cast.

## Scripting was the old lazy; prompting is the new lazy. Same spirit, shinier tools

Once upon a time, the creatively lazy wrote scripts to escape repetition. Macros in Excel. Bash aliases. Chrome extensions that autoclose annoying tabs. The tools varied, but the spirit remained the same: “I shouldn’t have to do this twice.”

What’s changed is the interface. We’re not writing `for i in range(10):` anymore. We’re typing: *“Summarize this 20-page doc in pirate voice and sort the action points by urgency.”* And the machine listens.

This isn’t new; it’s just more accessible. As Mollick puts it, "Automation has always been about eliminating work that is repetitive, and often dangerous or boring." What was once the province of code nerds in basements is now playground material for marketers, project managers, and your Aunt Susan who still double-spaces after periods.

Prompts are just scripts in a tuxedo. Or maybe a hoodie. Point is, they’re dressed for the occasion.

## And in the era of AI, the throne belongs not to the tireless grinder, but to the cunning delegator

Here’s where it gets spicy: you don’t even need to *do* the thing anymore—you just need to be the person who knows *what* should be done and *how* to offload it.

Bernard Marr, in his article *AI Delegation: The One Skill You Will Need To Succeed In The Future*, nails it: "Artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t going to replace people – but people who use AI are going to replace people who don’t."

That’s not career advice. That’s a weather report. The rain is falling, and the umbrella is called *delegation*. Marr again: "Managers that use AI will replace the managers that do not."

So the new power move isn’t hustle. It’s judgment. Can you tell what should be done by you, and what should be punted to the bots? Can you steer the intern who never sleeps, never unionizes, and never asks for a raise? Welcome to your empire.

**Final Thought:**

Being lazy in the right way has always been a kind of genius. The best engineers automate. The best leaders delegate. And the best writers know when to let the autocomplete finish the sentence.

So if you find yourself staring at a pile of boring tasks and thinking, *“There’s got to be a better way,”* congratulations—you’re already halfway to being the boss of the future.

The other half? Learning to prompt like a pro and delegate like a tyrant with excellent UX.

Lazy is the new black. Dress accordingly.
