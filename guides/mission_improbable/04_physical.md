## The Fine Art of Not Getting Shot

War for a non-shooter boils down to a primal skill: don’t be where the bullets are, and if you must be there, don’t be seen or hit by them. Easier said than done, but there are proven basics taught to every soldier that you, as a pacifist, must double-down on. 

> **“Don’t be where the bullets are, and if you must be there, don’t be seen or hit by them.”**

Since you won’t be firing back, you can’t rely on suppressing the enemy or killing them before they kill you. Your defense is **movement, cover, concealment, and raw human endurance**. Think of yourself as a professional survivor, not a warrior. Here’s how to practice the fine art of not getting shot:

### Move like Your Life Depends on It (Because It Does)

In battle, standing still or running in the open turns you into target practice. You need to master individual movement techniques that infantry use to dodge bullets – especially since you won’t be firing back to keep enemy heads down. The basics: **low crawl, high crawl, and rush**. 

> **“It’s far harder to hit a worm than a walking man.”**

The low crawl is your friend when things are really bad – you keep your body flat against the earth, making the smallest silhouette, and slither slowly from cover to cover. It’s exhausting, it’s muddy, but it’s far harder to hit a worm than a walking man. 

Use it when bullets are cracking overhead and there’s virtually no cover – you inch forward on your belly, face in the dirt, dragging your weapon or gear beside you (muzzle off the ground to avoid jams). High crawl is a bit faster – you’re on hands and knees but still low; use it when there’s some concealment (tall grass, bushes) but you still need to stay somewhat low. 

And then there’s the **3-5 second rush**: when you must expose yourself, you sprint from one cover spot to the next in a burst no longer than a few seconds. Why 3-5 seconds? Because in tests and practice, that’s often the time it takes for an enemy to notice you, aim, and fire accurately. 

If you’re already down again by second 6, the poor sod has to start over. Drill this: from behind a rock, pick the next ditch or wall, spring up and run like a rabbit *zig-zagging* if possible, then dive down and stay low. As the field manual dryly puts it, [“Each rush should last from 3 to 5 seconds. The rushes are kept short to keep enemy gunners from tracking you”](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/21-75/Ch3.htm). 

In essence, never give a sniper a stationary target. If you have to cross a street or open ground, do it unpredictably and fast.

### Cover and Concealment – Your Two Guardian Angels

*Cover* is anything that can physically stop a bullet; *concealment* is anything that hides you from view. You need both, but sometimes you only have one. A thick tree trunk, a sandbag wall, a stone building – these are cover (at least against light firearms). A shrub, a smoke screen, darkness – these are concealment (they won’t stop bullets, but they can stop a shooter from knowing you’re there). 

> **“Cover stops bullets; concealment stops eyes.”**

Rule number one: **[move from cover to cover whenever possible](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/21-75/Ch3.htm)**. Before you dash, identify your next cover spot. “Stop, look, and listen before moving. Look for your next position before leaving a position” as soldiers are taught. You don’t want to end up in the open wondering where to go. 

Rule number two: if you have only concealment, use it smartly. Camouflage yourself and gear (drape that poncho, mud up that shiny buckle). Blend with terrain – *the human eye is drawn to movement and human shapes*, so break up your outline and stay still when needed. 

If you think a sniper’s watching, freeze. A moving shadow or silhouette gives you away; a stationary lump often gets overlooked. **[Don’t skyline yourself](https://lowflyzone.tripod.com/info/fivess.html)**: this means never wander on a hilltop or ridgeline with the sky behind you – you’ll be a perfect silhouette target from miles away. 

Stay below crest lines and crawl if you must go over them. Similarly, hugging cover means just that – if you’re using a wall for cover, don’t stick your head up high above it; peek around corners or through low spots. And remember, concealment that *moves* with you (like smoke or darkness) is handy. 

Night and fog can be allies – patrols often move at night to avoid being seen (though then your ears become the enemy’s tool). Use natural cover: dips in the ground, piles of rubble, streambeds. These might not be obvious from far away, keeping you concealed and sometimes giving partial cover.

### Keep Quiet, Stay Dark

Noise and light can be as deadly as a tracer round – they draw fire. At night, sound travels far; a cough or the *clink* of gear can reveal you. Muffle metal parts with tape or cloth (military manuals literally advise taping dog tags and loose gear to prevent rattles). 

> **“A lit cigarette is a beacon in the dark.”**

Walk softly, step on the edges of your soles first to avoid snapping twigs (the “ghost walk” technique). If you have to communicate, whisper into an ear or use hand signals – whispering carries too if it’s quiet, so better to go right up to someone’s ear than speak aloud. 

At night, **[no smoking](https://lowflyzone.tripod.com/info/fivess.html)**: A lit cigarette is a beacon in the dark (that tiny cherry can be seen surprisingly far, and it *smells* – enemy scouts have literally found ambushes because someone couldn’t forgo a smoke). A flashlight or lit phone screen is even worse. 

Use light discipline: cover anything that glows, and if you *must* have a light (like to read a map), do it under a poncho or jacket to hide the glow. The old WWII slogan “loose lips sink ships” applies on the small scale too: loose noise and light get soldiers killed. 

You, not firing weapons, should *especially* be a ghost – silent and invisible as possible. Every bit of stealth stacks the odds in your favor.

### Know First Aid (for Yourself Too)

Even doing everything right, war is chaos – you might get shot or shrapnelled. If that happens and you’re still breathing, *you* might be your own first medic. This is where being a pacifist has zero conflict: you should **learn trauma care** like it’s religion. 

> **“60% of potentially survivable combat deaths are from bleeding out from arms or legs.”**

How to put on a tourniquet (and carry one in an easy-to-reach spot on your kit). How to pack a wound with gauze to stop bleeding. How to treat a sucking chest wound (hint: slap an airtight seal on it). The reason is stark: hemorrhage (major bleeding) is the [number one preventable killer on battlefields](https://www.militarytimes.com/2013/03/29/study-25-of-war-deaths-medically-preventable/). 

In fact, about [60% of potentially survivable combat deaths are from bleeding out from arms or legs](https://www.narescue.com/media/wysiwyg/CMS/additional_reading/pdfs/tccc.pdf). That means if you or a buddy are bleeding, a simple tourniquet or pressure bandage applied fast can literally decide life or death. 

As a pacifist, your mission is saving life – so embrace that. Carry extra bandages. If a comrade goes down, you can prove your worth and humanity by *immediately* doing what you do best: stopping the bleeding, keeping them breathing. 

Battlefield first aid also gives you a mental anchor – when hell breaks loose, focus on these concrete tasks (“stop bleed, check airway, treat for shock”). It keeps panic at bay and channels your energy into constructive action rather than freezing or freaking out. **Practice under stress** if you can (some militaries do realistic medical drills). It will pay off in autopilot response when real injuries happen.

Also, know the limits of bodies: how far you can push without food, water, or rest. Human endurance is incredible in short bursts – you can skip a night’s sleep, even two, in combat crunch time, but it will degrade your alertness drastically. 

After 24–48 hours without sleep, cognitive function nosedives (some studies show [combat effectiveness drops by up to 85% with just 4 hours of sleep a night](https://mrdc.health.mil/index.cfm/media/articles/2024/MOMRP_funds_fatigue_research) over a short period). So grab rest when you can. Even a 20-minute power nap in a lull can reset you a bit. 

Hydration: drink water regularly; dehydration sneaks up and saps your strength and thinking. Eat if food is there – going on an empty stomach makes you slower and weaker. Basically, **treat your body as the critical equipment it is**. 

> **“You can’t survive bullets if you collapse from exhaustion first.”**

You can’t survive bullets if you collapse from exhaustion first. War often becomes a marathon of attrition; the last standing wins. Don’t neglect basic self-care: dry your socks to prevent trench foot, use earplugs or improvise them to preserve hearing during explosions (you need your ears to catch sneaky movements), and stretch when you can to prevent cramps. 

These mundane things can be lifesavers when your body is your primary survival tool.

### Be Ready to Play Dead (Or Dumb)

If you’re truly caught in a hopeless situation – say you’re unarmed, under sudden attack, and surrounded – consider **playing dead** if escape or effective hiding isn’t an option. It’s a last resort, but it has saved people in battle and massacres. 

> **“Sometimes, not being there in the first place is the best strategy.”**

The trick is convincing acting: fall, get limp, control panic breathing. (Bonus grim tip: If there are actual corpses around, don’t be above smearing a bit of someone else’s blood on you to sell the effect.) This is risky – some enemies shoot bodies just to be sure – but if they’re moving fast they might not check closely. 

It goes without saying, if the enemy is the type to bayonet every fallen body, this won’t help. Use your judgment.

Better yet is **not being there in the first place**: if a firefight erupts, your plan as a noncombatant is *cover, concealment, crawl away if possible*. Let those with guns do their thing; your goal is to not become a statistic. 

If you’re with your unit, stick to your role – a medic focuses on wounded, a support guy might hunker down and guard gear. But if things really fall apart and you’re alone in No Man’s Land, survival mode engages: low profile, move carefully away from noise of battle toward safer areas (friendlies or at least away from crossfire). 

Avoid sudden movements if enemy troops are near – they’re trigger-happy. Melt into terrain.

One more aspect of not getting shot: **Don’t invite it by aggression.** Seems obvious for a pacifist, but in the fog of war, fear can push anyone to rash acts. If you aren’t going to shoot, definitely don’t bluff an attack – pointing an unloaded rifle at a scared enemy can make them *more* likely to shoot you. 

If cornered and discovered, sometimes surrender is safer than a stupid last stand (more on capture in a later section). Raising your hands and yelling that you’re noncombatant might or might not help, but appearing non-threatening is generally better than sudden moves. 

A lot of getting shot comes from being perceived as a threat. If you can safely signal “I am not a threat” (like displaying a Red Cross patch if you’re a medic, or literally dropping any weapon and showing empty hands), do it when it counts.

Finally, **respect the power of chaos:** sometimes you can do everything “right” and still rounds find you. Don’t despair; prepare. Wear your damn helmet and body armor if issued – it’s heavy and annoying but it drastically improves odds. Many soldiers alive today have a dented helmet on a shelf that “caught” the bullet meant for their skull. Same for armor plates stopping shrapnel. It’s not cowardly to use protection; it’s smart.

> **“Become hard to kill through tactics rather than violence.”**

In sum, surviving the battlefield without shooting back is about becoming hard to kill through tactics rather than violence. You become a ghost: quiet, low, unseen, here one second and gone the next. You move deliberately and intelligently, always thinking of the next cover, the next moment of safety. And when fate does throw you into harm’s way, you know how to treat a wound and keep moving. Master these skills and you tilt the survival odds in your favor, bullet by bullet, second by second.
