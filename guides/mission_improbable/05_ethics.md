## Moral Landmines

It’s not enough to dodge enemy fire; as a pacifist you also need to dodge the **moral booby traps** your own side may set under your feet. Modern warfare has countless ways to make people complicit in killing without ever pulling a trigger. That drone camera you operate? It guides a missile to a target – and you watch the explosion. The convoy you’re driving? Today it’s food rations, tomorrow it might be crates of ammo or a new experimental bomb. The intel report you transcribe? It could be coordinates for an airstrike that turns a village to ash. These are the **moral landmines** – tasks that seem “supporty” but carry the weight of lethal consequence. As a pacifist, you have to navigate these with extreme care. How do you *avoid* these duties without getting court-martialed or shot by your own side?

First, recognize them when they arise. Some are obvious: **Operating surveillance that directs killing** – e.g. being the guy who highlights targets on a live drone feed so the trigger-puller can fire a Hellfire missile. Some are less obvious: **Intelligence analysis** – you might think reading enemy radio chatter is benign, but if you relay “convoy at X location,” that might directly lead to an ambush or airstrike on that convoy. **Transporting munitions** – as mentioned, driving a truck of bullets is different in moral kind from driving a truck of bandages. Even **maintenance** can cross into a gray area if, say, you’re asked to arm the warhead of a cruise missile or test-fire a weapon. The extreme case: **research and development of weapons** – hopefully as a frontline pacifist you’re not in R\&D, but it’s worth noting many a pacifist scientist faced this in WWII (build the bomb or let the other side win). In the field, you might be asked to jury-rig a device that harms others (like setting up a pressure-plate detonation or rigging explosives to a bridge). These are moments your red line is approaching.

So what do you do? Here are some tactics for dodging moral landmines:

**The Bureaucratic Shuffle:** War is a bureaucracy; learn to use that. If given an order that inches you toward direct complicity (like “Specialist, monitor this feed and tell us when you see movement in the target house”), you might respond with some procedural delay. “Sir, I’m not trained for that system – it might be better if Sergeant X handles it,” or “Our SOP requires two certified analysts for that task; I’m not certified.” Basically, throw sand in the gears by invoking rules, regs, or feigned incompetence. Military bureaucracy loves training and certifications. No one wants to break protocol in sensitive operations. This can buy you time or get the task reassigned. **Feign technical issues** too: “I’m sorry, this equipment’s glitching, I can’t get a clear image.” If you’re managing comms, “The line is breaking up, I didn’t copy the last order clearly.” Be cautious – you can’t overplay this or you’ll attract suspicion or anger. But minor delays or a bit of apparent ineptitude at just the right moment can sometimes let an ugly order pass to someone else or become moot.

**Selective Ignorance:** If you don’t *know* the result of your work, it may feel less compromising – but this is a slippery slope and a personal call. Some support tasks are so far down the chain you can tell yourself, “I’m just doing X, what others do with it is on them.” For example, if you’re a radio operator asked to relay a coded message, you might not know it’s the order for a lethal strike. You did your job, you can sleep at night (maybe). However, if you are aware and that awareness gnaws at you, *manufacture ignorance*. Perhaps you don’t read that part of the report too closely, or you avoid asking what the convoy you’re scheduled to drive is carrying. Morally, willful ignorance is iffy – but in a war zone, sanity sometimes demands narrowing your focus. As long as you’re not directly observing the harm, your conscience might compartmentalize. This is what many do to cope: a clerk processing target folders might just stamp them without looking at the attached photos. Need-to-know can become a shield: convince yourself (and others) that you don’t need to know what’s in those crates.

**Trade or Beg Your Way Out:** If an order comes that crosses your line (e.g., “You – go with this team and operate the targeting laser for the strike on that building”), you might attempt a quick negotiation. Perhaps there’s a comrade who has less moral scruple and wouldn’t mind swapping. In a tight unit, soldiers often trade favors (“I’ll do your guard duty tomorrow if you take this one tonight,” etc.). Use that system. “Hey, Corporal, I’m really not steady with that laser designator, and you’ve used it before. Mind taking my spot? I’ll cover your radio watch.” Phrase it as practical – your buddy might even think he’s saving the mission from your incompetence. You get out of being the one painting a target for death; he gets a favor or bragging rights. If direct swap isn’t possible, **appeal to a superior privately** with honesty (only if you judge them safe). Something like: “Sir, I have reservations about being part of this particular action. I believe I’m more useful elsewhere.” This is *extremely* touchy – it borders on insubordination. But if you’ve built up a reputation (remember kissing up and being indispensable?), a sympathetic officer might cut you slack. They might assign someone else “for the good of the mission” if they sense you’ll perform poorly due to hesitations. You can even couch it as concern: “Lieutenant, if I hesitate or mess up, it could endanger others. Perhaps someone more prepared should do it.” You’re basically leveraging your pacifism as a supposed weakness to avoid doing something you morally oppose. It’s a gamble – a bad leader might just threaten you or think you cowardly; a good one might quietly shift you aside without making a scene.

**The Invisible Foot-Drag:** Similar to bureaucracy but more subtle – just *happen* to be slow enough that circumstances change. For instance, if ordered to load missiles onto a plane, you suddenly “discover” an issue: “Hang on, the loading tractor is low on fuel – need to refuel it” or “These munitions need a quick inspection, give me a few minutes.” Sometimes delays abort missions (target fled, ceasefire called, etc.). If luck is on your side, by the time you’re “done,” the morally troubling action is canceled or given to someone else in haste. It’s risky because if the mission goes ahead anyway, you could catch blame for being slow. But usually, militaries build in some slack. Just don’t use this too often on the same commander or they’ll catch on.

**Refuse, But Make It About Rules, Not Morals:** If cornered into a direct role in something heinous (say you’re asked to participate in what you believe is an unlawful act, like roughing up prisoners or targeting civilians), remember that soldiers *can* refuse an **illegal order**. By the laws of war, orders to commit atrocities are void and those who refuse them are in the right. In WWI, a few soldiers famously refused firing squads or civilian massacres and were not punished because the order was clearly illegal. If you perceive a task crosses legal lines (e.g., “shoot that unarmed prisoner”), you have a solid ethical and legal leg to stand on by saying no. Do so respectfully and cite the law: “Sir, I believe that order is unlawful under the laws of armed conflict.” This is high-stakes – you need to be absolutely sure it’s an illegal order and be ready to face backlash. But history suggests that refusing clearly illegal acts can be vindicated – for example, at the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, a few American soldiers refused to continue murdering civilians and were not court-martialed for that refusal. In fact, *obeying* unlawful orders can land you in prison later (the “just following orders” excuse doesn’t save war criminals). So in those extreme moral crisis moments, steel yourself to say *No*. You may save not just your soul but others’ lives.

For orders that are legal but against your conscience (like delivering ammo which will certainly be used to kill), the above tactic doesn’t apply straightforwardly – delivering ammo is legal, you just hate it. If you outright refuse a lawful order, you are in trouble (military law is clear on disobeying orders – it’s a crime). For those, you must be more creative as described (feign illness, trade off, etc.) rather than openly refuse. Open refusal is the **nuclear option** for a pacifist – you might reach it if asked to directly kill someone or do something egregious. Just know that refusing a lawful order (even a non-violent one) *will* bring consequences: punishment, possibly court-martial. Soldiers have been jailed for refusing to go on certain missions or deploy (e.g., some cited moral objections to specific wars).

So weigh it: is this the hill (literally) you’re willing to die on or at least go to jail for? Sometimes, it might be. If ordered to press a button that will kill dozens of civilians, your ethic might push you to flat refusal. If so, articulate it as above or on moral grounds if you must and prepare for fallout. Interestingly, a true pacifist might accept punishment as the price of keeping their integrity – it’s part of the code. But let’s try all other avenues first.

**Document and Expose (the Whistleblower’s Path):** This one is not about immediate survival but long-term conscience. If you find yourself repeatedly made complicit in something atrocious (say you’re analyzing drone footage and you witness what you believe are unlawful killings), you can collect evidence and plan to report it to higher authorities or even the press. This is essentially whistleblowing. It’s very risky for your military career and freedom (whistleblowers often get prison – see the case of Daniel Hale, a drone intelligence analyst who leaked information on civilian casualties and got 45 months in prison). But it’s a moral choice: you might save future lives by exposing wrongs. For example, the infamous “Collateral Murder” video (Iraq Apache helicopter gun-cam killing civilians) was leaked by a conscience-stricken analyst. That act didn’t save those already dead, but it shook the world’s view of the war. As a frontline pacifist, you likely won’t have access to grand secrets, but even reporting misconduct up the chain (to a chaplain, or an inspector general) is an option if you see war crimes. It might stop the moral landmine from claiming more souls. Just know this is a one-way trip – you’ll be labeled a snitch at best, traitor at worst, by many in your unit. It could end your survival prospects socially and career-wise.

Thus, whistleblowing is a last resort when your ethics can’t bear it and normal channels fail. If you go this route, try to get out of immediate danger first (a POW camp or jail cell is no place to leak info from). Also consider anonymous or third-party methods.

**Personal Moral Red Lines:** It helps to define for yourself what *your* uncompromisable limits are. Maybe you’re okay supporting combat operations generally (feeding troops, fixing trucks), but you draw the line at actively assisting a kill (like painting a target or loading a bomb). Know that line in advance. That way, if someone orders you across it, you recognize “This is it” and act according to your plan (delay, refuse, etc.). If you haven’t thought about it, heat of moment might cause you either to capitulate under pressure or to freeze and get others mad. By defining your lines, you also find creative ways to *avoid reaching them*. For example, if you know you’ll never shoot a prisoner, then maybe avoid ever being in charge of prisoners by steering away from MP (military police) duties. If you know you can’t stomach providing targeting intel, maybe gravitate your intel work to defensive analysis (like analyzing enemy supply routes rather than selecting strike targets).

One tricky moral landmine is **complicity by silence**: going along with unit cover-ups of atrocities or mistreatment. As a pacifist, you may witness fellow soldiers do cruel things. You’ll face the choice: speak up (and risk ostracism or worse), or stay silent (and share in moral guilt). There’s no easy answer. Many war memoirs talk about this burden – good men seeing bad things and feeling trapped. If you speak, you might prevent future horror but also possibly get “fragged” (your own could turn on you). If you stay silent, you live with it. Here’s a pragmatic approach: *document quietly, report safely later*. If something egregious happens (say civilians were harmed in violation of orders), gather any evidence subtly (mental notes, or hidden photos if possible). Later, when you can safely reach a higher authority or post-war investigation, give it. This protects you in the moment (you didn’t confront an angry armed squadmate on the spot) but still aims for justice eventually. It’s not perfect – injustices might continue in the meantime – but it’s a survival compromise.

**Beware “Just Doing My Job” Syndrome:** It’s easy to slide into moral numbness by telling yourself you’re just a cog. The truth is, war tries to make everyone a cog in the kill chain. The phrase “moral injury” describes the wound to one’s soul from perpetrating or enabling harm contrary to your values. Even if you never fire a bullet, if you feel you contributed to death unjustly, it will haunt you. One drone operator described feeling “haunted by a legion of the dead” and on the brink of suicide from the guilt of his role in remote killings. This is heavy stuff – and a pacifist is even more susceptible to such injury, because your conscience is hyper-attuned. So your mission is to avoid those compromising actions in the first place. But if you find you had to partake (maybe you drove that ammo truck and later heard it was used in a massacre), you need a plan to cope or atone (see **Foxhole Zen** next).

**The Court-Martial Cliff:** Let’s address the worst-case scenario: you couldn’t wiggle out, you refused a direct order to, say, join a combat patrol or fire on an enemy, and now your own command is coming down on you. You might be arrested, facing punishment. Historically, punishment for refusal can range from demotion and jail time to, in extreme wartime cases, execution (though that’s rare now – the last American executed for desertion was in 1945, but *attempted* disobedience in combat can still get you shot on the spot by a furious superior in some armies). In World War I, hundreds of soldiers were executed by their armies for “cowardice” or self-inflicted wounds. Knowing this, a smart pacifist rarely makes a grand refusal in the thick of battle – it’s often safer to feign illness or confusion than to scream “I refuse!” in front of bloodthirsty peers. But if you did end up on trial, you might invoke conscientious objection if your force recognizes it. Some modern militaries do have procedures for late-stage CO claims (you basically say “I can’t in good conscience continue serving in a combatant role”). This usually leads to discharge (often dishonorable) and maybe prison during wartime, but not execution. It’s a way to officially put your foot down. If you *survive* to reach a courtroom, articulate your pacifist beliefs clearly and consistently. Military legal systems may still punish you, but at least you’ve stood by your ethics openly.

Better is to avoid that cliff altogether with the quieter tactics above. The ideal is that by social engineering and assignment choices, you’re *never* put in the spot of “kill or be court-martialed.” It’s often doable – armies want willing killers in kill positions, not reluctant ones. Many a time, an insightful commander will not force a clearly non-violent soldier to be point man in a raid, because it endangers the unit’s success. They might quietly reassign you, as happened in some cases like Siegfried Sassoon in WWI: he publicly refused to continue fighting and instead of executing him, the British Army sent him to a hospital for “shell shock”. Essentially, they removed him from the war theater to avoid the embarrassment of a court-martial for a decorated hero. Similar outcomes can happen if you’ve proven your bravery in non-killing ways; they might sideline you instead of harshly punishing, figuring it’s best for all.

Your job is to **make it sensible for them to not use you in morally hazardous roles**. Be so good in your chosen niche that it’s a no-brainer to leave you there. And if all fails, be ready to say no to true atrocity, come what may. You have to live with yourself, possibly for many years after the war, and living with a clear conscience (or at least one less burdened by guilt) is worth a lot. As one senior officer later reflected with regret, “we sometimes failed to make wise choices... we should have known better”. You, trying to “know better” in the moment, might save yourself from that same regret.

In navigating moral landmines, you walk a razor’s edge. Too much open morality and your own side might brand you a traitor; too little and you lose the very principles you’re fighting to keep. Use every ounce of cunning, empathy, and tact. Remember that ultimately *you* are the one who answers to your conscience. No military order can absolve you of that inner tribunal. So avoid what you must, endure what you have to, and keep your moral compass hidden but intact. You’re not just surviving a war; you’re surviving **yourself**.
