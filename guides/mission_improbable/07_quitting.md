## Ghosting the Battlefield (Tactic Zero)

Sometimes, despite all strategy and goodwill, you hit a wall: a situation so untenable that your only remaining survival tool is **escape by any means necessary**. This is the chapter for when all else fails – when your ethics or sheer survival instinct compel you to *get out* of the situation entirely, even at great personal risk. 

> **“Ghosting the battlefield – the nuclear options of personal survival.”**

We’re talking about **deliberate self-injury to get sent away, faking illness or insanity, getting captured on purpose, or outright desertion**. These are extreme measures – the *nuclear options* of personal survival – and they come with heavy consequences. But history is full of soldiers who resorted to exactly these tactics when they just couldn’t take it anymore. Let’s weigh the dirty details of each “ghosting” method:

### Self-Injury (the Blighty Ticket)

In past wars, troops desperate to leave the trenches would sometimes shoot themselves in a hand or foot – a wound bad enough to get sent home but not usually fatal. The British in WWI called it the “Blighty wound” (Blighty = home) – a ticket out of hell. This is **incredibly dangerous on many levels**. 

> **“Men were executed for self-inflicted wounds as an example to others.”**

First, you might misjudge and do more damage than intended (there were cases of soldiers dying from infection or shattering a leg bone and being crippled for life). Second, if you’re caught or if the wound is obviously self-inflicted, you face severe punishment. 

In World War I, self-inflicted wounds were a capital offense; men *were executed* for it as an example. Even in modern forces, it’s a crime (malingering or self-injury to avoid duty). At the very least you’d get a court-martial, prison time, and a shameful discharge. So, this is not a decision to take lightly (pun intended). 

You’d have to fool medics that it was an accident or enemy fire. Some soldiers in WWI got crafty – e.g. using a pistol with a timer rig (so it’d shoot them when they were down the line, appearing like a sniper got them), or shooting through an object to mask powder burns. 

But many were found out – by trajectory, powder residue, etc. Even those who got away with it had to carry that secret (and maybe a missing finger) for life.

That said, if you’re at the edge of mental collapse or moral event horizon, a wound can be oddly “welcome” – people have stood up recklessly in firefights subconsciously hoping to catch a non-lethal bullet. That’s essentially slow-motion self-harm. 

The better route: if you truly can’t continue, *simulate* an injury rather than cause one. Which leads to...

### Faking Illness or Insanity

Malingering (faking illness) is as old as armies. Soldiers have feigned everything from dysentery to madness to get out of combat. Unlike shooting yourself, this at least doesn’t cause you bodily harm – though if discovered, it’s punishable as well. 

> **“Research symptoms that aren’t easily measured – no one can see your headache.”**

To succeed, you need acting skills and some medical plausibility. *Physical illness:* Complaining of severe back pain, or non-obvious ailments like chronic stomach pain or migraine, can be hard to disprove. 

During Vietnam, some draftees used elaborate tricks to fail psych exams or physicals (like eating a bar of soap to induce fever for the physical). In the field, getting sent to rear due to illness might require you to fool the medics, who’ve seen it all. 

If you choose this, research or recall symptoms that aren’t easily measured. For instance, claim debilitating headaches and blurred vision (no one can *see* your headache). However, military doctors might label you with “combat fatigue” or so and just give you a rest and send you back. It’s a dice roll.

*Insanity/mental breakdown:* One famous example is in WWII, a US soldier named [Eddie Slovik tried to claim mental unfitness to avoid combat; it didn’t save him (he ended up executed for desertion – a cautionary tale)](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-31/the-execution-of-pvt-slovik). 

But others have pulled off appearing catatonic or hysterical to be pulled off the line. Be warned: if you’re too convincing, you may end up in a psych ward or medicated heavily, which, while safer than bullets, is not fun. And again, if believed to be faking, you’ll be disciplined.

A more minor form of fakery: **exaggerating a real minor injury**. Twisted your ankle? Hobble like it’s broken. Got a mild cough? Turn it into a hacking pneumonia. This might get you light duty or a few days off. 

Historically, soldiers called these small reprieves “taking a sick day” in their own slang. It’s temporary but sometimes that short respite can recalibrate your nerves. Just don’t cry wolf too often – medics and officers will notice a pattern.

### Passive Resistance (The Quiet Quit)

Instead of an overt fake or injury, you can *ghost* in a figurative sense: become non-effective. If you move slowly, appear utterly exhausted, screw up tasks (not dangerously, just enough to be a burden), higher-ups might remove you from front line roles simply because you’re not pulling weight. 

> **“Never refuse, but never really do it – be the perennial 'screw-up’ they won’t trust with combat.”**

This is the “never refuse, but never really do it” approach some conscripts used historically. They didn’t say no; they just did everything so half-heartedly or clumsily that eventually they were reassigned to less critical duties. 

The risk: in a disciplined army, this can get you punished for dereliction. But in a chaotic war, some slip through the cracks by being the perennial “screw-up” – ironically, being a slacker can save you if it means they won’t trust you with heavy combat responsibility. 

It’s not exactly honorable soldiering, but your goal is staying alive and moral, not winning best soldier of the year.

### Surrendering (Intentional Capture)

This is a dire step – essentially betting on the enemy’s mercy. If you truly cannot fight or continue, you might at some point let yourself be captured. For example, in a hopeless battle some soldiers have dropped weapons and raised hands or stayed behind hiding until enemy sweeps through to pick up prisoners. 

> **“POW life can range from relatively humane to hellish – research your enemy’s track record.”**

If you do this, do it wisely: white flags or clear surrender postures (hands up, weapon discarded) ideally when an enemy group is close enough to see you clearly and not just shoot you on sight. Being captured could take you *out* of the war – but into a new ordeal. 

POW life can range from relatively humane ([if captured by forces that obey Geneva Conventions](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciii-1949/article-13/commentary/1960)) to hellish (if captured by those who torture or execute prisoners). Research your enemy’s track record. 

Surrendering to Canadians in WWII, probably okay. Surrendering to, say, an extremist militia known for beheading captives – obviously a terrible idea. If capture is viable, once a POW you ironically regain some rights. 

The Third Geneva Convention says POWs must be treated humanely – enough food, no torture, etc. Not all enemies follow it, but many do to some extent, if only to encourage enemy surrenders (propaganda value). 

As a pacifist, being a POW might actually be more consonant with your belief than being a combatant – you’re out of the fight. But you’re also powerless and at the whims of captors.

Historically, some soldiers in hopeless positions chose capture. Thousands surrendered in big wars rather than die for lost causes. And many survived the war as POWs. But some POW mortality rates were grim (e.g., Soviet POWs in German camps or vice versa had huge death rates). 

Weigh that against near-certain death or moral compromise if you stay in. If your own side is also suspect (they might shoot “cowards” trying to surrender), be tactical: maybe get separated so your disappearance is ambiguous (MIA). 

In modern times, being a POW also means you might eventually be repatriated when the war ends or in a prisoner exchange. You will face stigma at home possibly (“why didn’t you fight to the death?” some might say), but at least you *have* a home to go to.

### Desertion

This is the ultimate ghosting – literally vanishing from your army. Desertion means sneaking away from your unit with no intention of coming back. It’s different from surrender since you’re not turning yourself to the enemy, you’re just *gone*. 

> **“In wartime, many nations enforce draconian penalties for deserters – imprisonment at best, death at worst.”**

Maybe you plan to hide out until conflict’s over, or try to reach neutral territory, or just melt into the civilian landscape. The upsides: if you succeed, you’re out of immediate danger and no longer have to follow orders or fight. 

The downsides: if caught by your military, expect severe punishment. In wartime, many nations enforce draconian penalties for deserters to deter others – imprisonment at best, death at worst. 

The famous example: in WWI, [306 British soldiers were executed for desertion and related offenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_at_Dawn_Memorial). In WWII, many armies imprisoned deserters (the US executed only one – Eddie Slovik – but others got long prison terms). 

In recent conflicts, execution of deserters is rare (most modern armies use jail), but some authoritarian regimes still might shoot them.

To desert successfully, you need a plan: *when and where* to slip away, *how* to survive afterward, and possibly *new identity*. Ideally, desert far from front lines – rear areas have less immediate scrutiny and maybe you can literally walk out of camp if lax. 

> **“Desert during a chaotic retreat or advance when people are scattered.”**

Or during a chaotic retreat or advance when people are scattered. Some Vietnam draftees straight up walked off base and blended into the host nation or found sympathetic locals. Others headed for known sanctuaries (like some US deserters made it to Canada or Sweden during Vietnam – though that’s easier from home soil than a distant battlefield). 

In Iraq/Afghanistan wars, desertion was difficult in theater (language, being an obvious foreigner) but some did simply disappear in cities. If you’re fighting on your home turf (like a civil war or being invaded in your country), desertion might mean literally going home or hiding in familiar terrain.

Keep in mind the survival aspect: on the run, alone, likely unarmed or low on supplies, you could die of exposure or get captured by enemy or bandits. If you head for neutral ground, know the route, have some civilian clothes perhaps. 

If you trust someone local (maybe a civilian friend), they might hide you – extremely risky for them too. There have been instances of deserters hiding for years (Japanese holdouts post-WWII, though they believed war still ongoing – reverse scenario). 

In modern warfare with electronic IDs and such, it’s harder to vanish. But in war zones, plenty of chaos can cover your tracks for a while.

Ethically, desertion is you saying “My obligation to personal morality/survival outweighs my duty to this military.” As a pacifist, that’s a coherent stance. But consider the effect on your comrades – are you leaving them one person short in a tight spot? 

There’s a reason desertion is reviled by militaries: it can endanger units if people vanish mid-battle. If your desertion would directly screw over your buddies (like you’re the only medic and you bail before a battle), that’s a heavy choice. You might try to desert at a lull or when you’re non-critical.

If you manage to ghost the battlefield, what then? If you survive to see war’s end, you might face legal consequences unless an amnesty is declared. Some wars end with pardon for deserters (like decades later, Britain pardoned those 306 WWI “cowards” officially). 

But you may live as a fugitive for a long time. Are you okay with that? Some can’t return home for fear of arrest (there are still Vietnam-era US deserters living in Canada, decades later).

#### Deliberate Capture vs. Desertion – a thought

Desertion you’re solo, in capture you’re monitored but at least fed (usually). Some pacifists might prefer capture (sort of like conscientious objection after the fact: “I’m now a noncombatant POW”). 

> **“As a pacifist, being a POW might be more consonant with your belief than being a combatant.”**

The down side is you’re still in war’s machinery, just on the other side of the fence. Some POWs were mistreated, used for propaganda, or even killed in reprisal. Weigh your enemy’s reputation. If they tend to treat POWs decently, surrender might be the safer bet than wandering unknown territory as a deserter.

### Mutiny or Group Refusal

This is rarer and extremely perilous, but if you aren’t alone in your disillusionment, small mutinies have occurred where men collectively say “no” to suicidal orders (like French army mutinies in 1917 – many were jailed, some shot, but the army did back off some offensives). 

> **“There’s safety in numbers if a bunch desert together.”**

In Vietnam, the phenomenon of “fragging” – troops killing their own aggressive officers – was a form of mutiny born of desperation. As a pacifist, fragging is off the table for you (you’re not going to kill even an officer you hate), but be aware it happened when survival instincts override discipline. 

There’s also the “organized desertion” – whole units melting away. If morale collapse reaches a tipping point, your best hope is you’re not the only one wanting out. Then it’s more of a collapse than you individually being the nail sticking out. 

This you can’t engineer; it either happens or not. But keep ears open if fellow soldiers start saying “screw this, let’s bail.” There’s safety in numbers if a bunch desert together (someone to watch your back on the run). Of course, there’s also more chance of being noticed/caught if a large group goes missing.

### Legal Out – Conscientious Objection Status

If by some miracle your military allows conscientious objection during service, you might formally request it. For instance, the U.S. has (rarely) let active duty folks shift to noncombatant roles or discharge if they prove a sincere religious/moral change of heart. 

> **“If approved for conscientious objection status, you’re out legitimately.”**

It’s a long shot, and doing this in a foxhole is impossible; it’s more a bureaucratic process for rear areas. But if you’re ever rotated out or in a hospital for a while, you could start that paperwork. It’s slow and might be denied – but if approved, you’re out legitimately. 

Downside: you might spend remainder of war in a prison anyway if they doubt you and deny it.

### Weighing Consequences

Ghosting the battlefield is the *ultimate moral gamble*. You avoid having to kill, possibly save your life, but you might exchange one peril for another – prison, execution, disgrace, or survival guilt if others died in your absence. 

> **“Your life and soul are precious. No matter what the propaganda says, you are not obligated to throw them away.”**

There’s no sugarcoating it: it’s a desperate move. But wars push people to desperation. The fact that thousands have shot themselves in foot, or run into the woods, or broken down sobbing until sent to an asylum, shows that *for some, the breaking point comes*.

If you reach yours, here’s advice: **your life and soul are precious**. No matter what the propaganda says, you are not obligated to throw them away. Yes, society may punish you, but societies also eventually reconcile with the truth that not every war or battle was worth a life. 

Many deserters have been quietly forgiven by history. In the moment though, you act knowing the immediate price. Try to minimize harm to others in your escape. If you can’t fight anymore, at least do something like leaving ammo or supplies for your mates when you slip off, or guiding that wounded private to safety before you fade into the night.

And if you do desert or surrender and survive – *seek help afterward*. The psychological toll of being branded a coward or traitor can eat you alive if you let it. But remember, **you did what you had to do to preserve life**. 

> **“To a pacifist, preserving life is not cowardice but courage of a different kind.”**

That, to a pacifist, is not cowardice but courage of a different kind. In 100 years, maybe no one will know your name to pardon it, so you must pardon yourself. You kept breathing and you kept your conscience (if somewhat battered).

In practical terms, many deserters from brutal wars went on to live quiet, productive lives under the radar. Some wrote memoirs under pseudonyms late in life. Some only told family on deathbeds, receiving understanding and forgiveness. 

The world goes on, and one war (however huge now) becomes history. The victor’s justice might brand you wrong, but your own integrity and the passage of time might judge you less harshly.

### Contingency: If Forced to Stay – Make Yourself Non-Lethal

If escape isn’t possible and you’re stuck in the fight, you might adopt micro-resistance. For example, intentionally aim high and miss if forced to shoot (many soldiers throughout history did – there’s evidence a lot of line infantry intentionally missed the enemy due to innate aversion to killing). 

> **“Many soldiers throughout history intentionally missed when firing at the enemy.”**

Sabotage weapons subtly (not to endanger comrades but to reduce lethality – e.g., miscalibrate a sight on the artillery so it overshoots a bit, though that has risks). It’s a grim compromise: you’re still in uniform, but you quietly subvert killing effectiveness. 

Just know if caught doing this, repercussions are severe.

This is indeed *Tactic Zero* – it’s what you use when the normal tactics (1 through 5 above) have failed or you simply can’t continue. It’s called “ghosting” because you are effectively removing yourself from the battlefield equation. 

You become a non-factor for the war – either by wearing an enemy POW number or literally disappearing. War, which demands total commitment, hates the ghost. But your goal isn’t to please war; it’s to survive with your humanity.

In conclusion, consider Ghosting only when you’re at rock bottom. Plan it as best you can, execute swiftly, and accept the consequences as the cost of reclaiming your life. 

> **“You’ve essentially performed the ultimate pacifist act: you’ve unilaterally exited the cycle of violence.”**

If you pull it off, you’ve essentially performed the ultimate pacifist act: you’ve unilaterally exited the cycle of violence. You won’t get medals or parades – likely scorn or prison – but if it saves your life or soul, that might be worth it.
