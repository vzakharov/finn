## Foxhole Zen & Other Coping Tricks

War is as much a mental battle as a physical one. Perhaps even more so for a pacifist, who carries the extra weight of moral conflict. How do you keep your sanity and humanity intact under relentless stress, fear, and horror? 

The answer is a mix of psychological body armor: call it **Foxhole Zen** – a state of centered calm amidst chaos – plus humor, ritual, and maybe a pinch of dissociation to get through the day. Let’s explore the coping tricks that can help you survive mentally without turning into either a nervous wreck or a hardened, unfeeling shell.

### Embrace the Suck – Then Laugh at It

“Embrace the suck” is military slang for accepting that miserable conditions are normal. As a pacifist, you’re not exempt from mud, cold, hunger, boredom, terror – you just have an added layer of *hating the whole premise*. One healthy approach is *dark humor*. 

> **“Laughing in a foxhole doesn’t mean you’re callous; it means you’re human.”**

Soldiers throughout history have used [gallows humor to stay sane](https://www.cmi.no/publications/file/8619-warfun-diaries-vol-1.pdf). Jokes about the lice in the trench, or calling the nighttime mortar bombardment your “fireworks show”. It’s ironic, it’s bitter, but it can transmute fear into something bearable. 

Laughing in a foxhole doesn’t mean you’re callous; it means you’re human. Research on troop psychology shows that humor can be a powerful stress relief, creating camaraderie and moments of psychological respite amidst dread. 

So swap absurd one-liners with your buddies (“If I get any more mud on me, I’ll be promoted to sandbag”). Tell ridiculous stories. Even morbid jokes (“We’re so far forward, the enemy is behind us – guess we’ll attack in the other direction!”). 

It’s not about making light of tragedy but about lightening the unbearable weight of it for a bit. Just be sensitive – humor shouldn’t target anyone suffering worse than you or come off as cruel. Unit humor often gets weird and profane, and that’s okay. It bonds you. Those who can laugh together can survive together.

### Micro-Rituals for Macro-Chaos

Ritual isn’t only for religion – any repetitive, meaningful act can give you a sense of control and normalcy. In a world where any moment can be life or death, **having little routines** provides mental structure. 

It might be as simple as making a cup of ersatz coffee in the morning and taking exactly three sips before speaking. Or cleaning your gear in a certain order every evening. Or saying a quick quiet prayer or mantra before you step out on patrol (many soldiers do – “please let me get through this” – even atheists find themselves addressing the universe). 

These rituals give your brain a signal: *I’m managing something*. [“They give order to the chaos of our lives,”](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/the-ritual/) as one military anthropology lecture put it. For example, a lot of troops have a **pre-mission ritual**: maybe they kiss a photo of loved ones, or check their lucky charm in their pocket, or have a handshake with their battle buddy. 

Some literally rub a talisman or whisper the same phrase (“Here we go, here we go…"). These acts are not magical, but they soothe. They create a tiny bubble of certainty (“I always do this, and I’m still here, so I’ll do it again for luck”). 

As a pacifist, your rituals can also be moral anchors: maybe writing a quick journal entry whenever you can, reaffirming why you’re not firing bullets, to remind yourself you’re still *you*. Or performing a small compassionate act each day (feeding a stray dog at base, or giving a candy to a local kid). Those become your spiritual bread crumbs leading you out of the moral maze.

### Mindfulness in the Mayhem

This is the “Zen” part. Mindfulness means focusing on the present moment without judgment. In a foxhole under bombardment, it might simply mean noticing your breath (“I’m alive *now*, inhale, exhale”), feeling the dirt under your nails, hearing your heartbeat. 

> **“Right now, I’m scared, my heart’s pounding, but I’m still here.”**

These grounding techniques can short-circuit panic. Instead of catastrophizing (“I’m gonna die, we’re all gonna die”), bring it to *now*: “Right now, I’m scared, my heart’s pounding, but I’m still here.” Some soldiers spontaneously do this; others learn it through training or necessity. 

If you had any meditation practice before, try to keep it up in micro-doses. Even a 5-minute meditation at dawn behind the bunker can steel your mind. If formal meditation seems impossible, do micro-meditations: while on guard duty, attune to the environment – count the crickets chirping, or watch the sunrise and note the colors. 

That focus can crowd out intrusive fear thoughts. Another trick: **box breathing** – inhale for 4 counts, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4, repeat. It’s a known technique to calm the autonomic nervous system (used by special forces too). 

It can help prevent panic attacks or calm you before doing something stressful (like heading out on patrol). Essentially, find mental stillness whenever you can. It helps process trauma slowly rather than all at once hitting you at night.

### Dissociate – Just a Little

Dissociation gets a bad rap, but in moderation it’s a protective mechanism. It’s that feeling of being slightly detached from reality, like watching yourself in a movie. In extreme form it’s not healthy (it’s a symptom of PTSD when uncontrollable). But short-term, consciously used, it can blunt immediate horror. 

> **“Use dissociation like painkiller meds: the lowest effective dose to dull the pain.”**

For instance, some medics talk about “flipping a switch” and treating wounded like they’re just mechanics working on a broken engine – that’s a form of adaptive dissociation. You might tell yourself, “This isn’t me, this is soldier-me doing what needs to be done,” almost like adopting a persona. 

Or during a terrifying artillery barrage, you might mentally escape to a memory or a fantasy – picturing your childhood home, or planning what you’ll do on leave – essentially *checking out* for a moment. The key is coming back when needed. 

If you find yourself emotionally numb, that can be dissociation too – a common one is feeling like it’s all unreal, like you’re in a dream. As long as you can still function, a bit of that *might* help you not break down crying when things are intense. 

Many veterans report feeling “numb” or “on autopilot” in combat – it got them through it. The danger is if you get *too* numb and detached, you might not respond to real threats properly or might have a delayed psychological reckoning later. So use sparingly. 

Think of it like painkiller meds: use the lowest effective dose to dull the pain, but don’t become completely anesthetized lest you get hurt without noticing.

### Connect to Home (Carefully)

One of the biggest boosts to morale is contact with loved ones. A letter from home, an email or phone call if available, can remind you why you want to survive and that a world exists beyond the war. In WWII, they said “No mail, low morale” – it was *vital* for soldiers to get letters. 

For you, hearing from family or friends might reaffirm your identity beyond “soldier.” It gives hope and something to look forward to (“Only 2 months left of this tour, then I’m back to my dog and my garden”). If possible, write back. Pour your thoughts out – it can be cathartic. 

Of course, be mindful of censorship and not worrying your family too much (common advice was to “keep it light” so as not to freak out folks back home). But you can still express love, aspirations, even subtle frustrations. That outlet is gold. 

In downtime, read those letters or look at photos. It’s not escapism; it’s *resilience*. It keeps the flame alive that you have a life beyond war, which helps you endure war.

### Peer Support and Confidants

While you likely can’t openly discuss your pacifism with most around you, find at least one battle buddy you trust enough to vent in *some* way. Maybe it’s not grand philosophical talks, but just someone you can say “Man, this is messed up” to, and they nod. 

> **“Human connection in trauma is critical. If you bottle everything, it festers.”**

Human connection in trauma is critical. If you bottle everything, it festers. If you have a friend who also feels disillusioned (there often are some quietly questioning souls), you can mutter dark observations to each other while cleaning rifles or digging trenches. 

Even a shared eye-roll when the CO spouts gung-ho nonsense is a relief. It says “I’m not alone in seeing the absurdity.” In the best case, maybe there’s a chaplain or counselor – someone officially there to talk. 

Many troops avoid therapists or chaplains out of stigma, but if one’s available and you’re struggling, consider it. They are bound by confidentiality to an extent and might give you coping tips (it’s literally their job to keep soldiers sane).

Also, partake in group venting rituals carefully. Soldiers often make parodies of officers or stupid regulations as a group (just not within earshot of said officers). Joining in those gripe sessions bonds you and releases stress. 

Just avoid letting slip “I think this whole war is immoral” in the wrong crowd – stick to immediate shared miseries (“This rain can go to hell” – safe!).

### Spiritual and Philosophical Coping

If you’re religious or spiritual, lean on that. Prayer, reading holy texts, or even philosophical literature (if you smuggled a small book) can provide comfort and guidance. A lot of pacifists in war have cited their faith or philosophy as what sustained them. 

> **“Nurture your soul. War will try to starve it.”**

For example, a conscientious objector medic might recite scriptures about loving enemies to remind them why they won’t pick up a gun. If you’re not traditionally religious, you might still find solace in the *idea* that there’s meaning or goodness beyond this brutality. 

Some find meaning in nature – noticing a sunrise or stars at night and thinking, “There is beauty still.” Others cling to principles of humanism – perhaps you comfort yourself that by not killing, you maintain a light of humanity in a dark place. 

That can be a source of quiet pride: *I’m preserving a shred of what’s right*. It’s a double-edged sword because if everyone around you is gung-ho, you might feel isolated in those thoughts, but it can also be your inner fortress.

Rituals can be explicitly spiritual too: saying the rosary, meditating on Buddhist precepts, or even simple visualization of a peaceful place. A small item like a cross or other symbol worn under your shirt can remind you of your higher values when things get ugly. 

Essentially, *nurture your soul*. War will try to starve it.

### Compartmentalize the Horror

Cognitive strategies often involve compartmentalization – putting different thoughts in “boxes.” You can have your soldier persona that deals with the immediate tasks and terror, and separately keep your pacifist, reflective self tucked away for safer times. 

> **“Compartmentalize then decompartmentalize when you can.”**

This is tricky – you don’t want to become split or fake. But temporarily, you might need to. Tell yourself: *“Right now, I focus on surviving and helping my buddies. Later, I will process what this all means.”* It’s like scheduling an emotional breakdown for a later date. 

Soldiers in combat often do this intuitively: they push emotions aside and function, then maybe break down crying in a safe zone afterward. Allow yourself that delay. If a traumatic event happens (say you saw a friend killed or civilians hit by accident), you might not have time to emotionally react fully – you’re still in danger. 

So steel up, do what you need to (treat wounds, carry on). When relative safety comes, **do not skip the processing**. Find a moment alone or with a confidant and acknowledge what happened and how you feel. 

If you need to cry, do it privately (nothing unmanly or unwomanly about it, but public crying in the army can unfortunately draw unwanted attention). If you keep shoving it down forever, that’s how PTSD blooms later. 

So your task is compartmentalize *then decompartmentalize* when you can. The war might not afford a counseling session, but even writing down in a diary, “Today was awful. I’m angry and heartbroken that we… etc.” is a form of decompression. 

Some WWII soldiers wrote incredibly honest diary entries in foxholes. Those diaries (if found by buddies) would’ve been seen as weakness then, but now they are treasures of understanding and they clearly helped those men stay sane in the moment.

### Find Meaning in Small Things

Viktor Frankl, a psychologist who survived concentration camps, wrote about finding meaning as a route to survival. In war, big-picture meaning (why are we here fighting?) may evade or disgust you. But *small meaning* can sustain. 

> **“This is your own war: a war to keep your humanity.”**

Maybe you’re not here for the geopolitical aims, but you’re here for the guy next to you – to get him home safe. Maybe your purpose is to bear witness – to see and remember the truth of war so you can advocate for peace later. 

Or it’s as simple as, “If I can alleviate one person’s pain today, I’ve done something good in this hell.” Focus on those micro-purposes. They give you a reason to endure another day beyond just fear of death. 

Pacifists often have strong guiding ethics – lean into yours. Remind yourself why you value life, why you refuse to kill. That *why* can carry you through dark moments when you worry you’re cowardly or crazy for not conforming. 

You’re not crazy; you’re principled. In a twisted way, *this is your own war*: a war to keep your humanity. Frame it like that and you become not a passive object but an active fighter (just fighting for life and decency rather than against an enemy).

### Mental Health Under Fire

Let’s acknowledge the obvious – war causes trauma. Anxiety, nightmares, despair, anger – you will feel all of it at times. You might question your pacifism when friends die (“Should I have picked up a rifle? Could I have saved them by fighting?”). 

> **“Focus on what you did right, not just on the unavoidable wrongs around you.”**

Survivor’s guilt can hit you if others perish doing what you refused to do. Depression can creep in – a sense of hopelessness in the face of carnage. These are normal reactions; they don’t mean you’re weak or that your beliefs are wrong. 

This is where professional knowledge helps: being aware of things like **PTSD** (post-traumatic stress) symptoms. Hyper-vigilance (always on edge), emotional numbness or swings, intrusive memories – if you notice these, employ coping strategies early. 

Talk to someone, do breathing exercises, try to get proper rest. If your unit has a mental health officer or chaplain, there’s no shame in using them (though stigma exists – perhaps approach under guise of some other issue if needed). 

Remember that literally half of soldiers report issues with stress and many quietly seek support; you wouldn’t be an outlier. Sometimes even admitting to a buddy “I’m really shook up” invites them to confide the same and you both feel less alone.

There’s also a concept of **moral injury** we touched on – feeling you’ve transgressed your own ethics by participating in war. As a pacifist, you might suffer this even if you didn’t kill – just being part of destruction can wound you internally. 

Healing that might become a long-term project (likely after war, through therapy, spiritual counsel, activism for peace, etc.). In the meantime, you cope by remembering you did the best you could under circumstances. 

You preserved life where possible, you stayed true by not taking life. Focus on what you *did right*, not just on the unavoidable wrongs around you.

### The Power of Imagery and Memory

When things are at their worst, have a mental refuge to retreat to. That could be recalling your happiest memory in detail – let’s say a beach trip with family: recall the smell of the ocean, the laughter, the warm sun. Close your eyes and *be there* for a minute. 

> **“Mental imagery is like a mini-vacation for your psyche.”**

Or vividly imagine a future scene – finishing your first hot shower back home, or hugging your partner at the airport. Such visualization can create real emotional relief; it’s like a mini-vacation for your psyche. 

Some soldiers carry a pocket notebook with positive quotes or letters and read them in tough moments to ground themselves. Even a photograph taped inside your helmet can be a talisman – one glance at your kids’ faces can both motivate you to survive and soften your heart so you don’t become a monster.

### Tiny Comforts

Do not underestimate the boost from small comforts. A piece of candy squirreled away, a dry pair of socks, a few minutes with your boots off, a favorite song quietly hummed – these little things keep the human being alive inside the soldier. 

Stock up on a few comfort items before deployment if you can (many bring something like a good luck charm, a certain snack, a lightweight book). Indulge in them when morale is low. Soldiers in WWI famously had rituals like tea time in trenches – absurd but it gave a sense of civilization in hell. 

Maybe for you it’s making a cup of instant coffee and offering some to others, turning it into a “coffee ritual” each morning. It signals: we’re still human, we can still enjoy something.

### Help Others Cope

One paradoxical coping method is to focus on helping those around you with *their* stress. If a buddy is panicking, you calm them; if someone’s crying for their mother after being wounded, you hold their hand and assure them. Being the steady presence for others can actually stabilize *you*. 

> **“Being the steady presence for others can actually stabilize you.”**

It forces you to project calm and thus feel it. It also reinforces your pacifist purpose: you’re here to heal and comfort, not harm. By being a sort of unofficial counselor to your peers (listening to their worries, cracking a joke when needed, encouraging them), you create a mini-bubble of humanity. 

Your foxhole or tent can become a zone of relative peace where folks know “hey, with this guy, I can be real.” That not only helps them, it affirms your identity daily.

### Know When You Need a Break

Even the strongest minds need downtime. In war, you may not get it when you want, but when you do, take it. If you find yourself nearing a breaking point – maybe you almost lashed out at a comrade or you froze in fear too long – see if you can rotate out for a bit. 

> **“It’s better to say ‘I need a day’ than have a meltdown with a loaded weapon in hand.”**

Sometimes units have a rear area rotation (going to base camp for a week of rest). If you get that chance, use it. Don’t macho it out and volunteer to stay at the front if you’re given R\&R (some do out of misplaced loyalty). Take the rest. 

Sleep in a cot, eat a hot meal, stare at a sunrise without worrying about snipers. Let your nervous system recalibrate. Modern armies know the value of brief respites – it’s proven to reduce psychiatric casualties if soldiers periodically get a breather. 

And if you feel on the verge of mental collapse, it’s better to quietly mention it to a medic or superior and be pulled to light duty for a bit, than to snap in the field where you or others could be hurt. 

There was stigma historically (“shell shock” victims were seen as weak), but by now most leaders would prefer a soldier say “I need a day” than have a meltdown with a loaded weapon in hand.

To sum up, **Foxhole Zen** is finding inner stillness amid outward chaos. It’s combining acceptance of the situation with belief in something beyond it. It’s taking care of your mind and soul as diligently as you take care of your rifle (or stretcher or radio). 

> **“By coping well, you might even be a light for others in the darkness.”**

Through humor, routine, camaraderie, spirituality, and plain mental discipline, you keep yourself *yourself*. War will change you – it changes everyone – but you aim to let it temper you into a wiser, more compassionate being, not break you into a cruel or hopeless one. 

By coping well, you not only survive with sanity, you might even be a light for others in the darkness. And that, for a pacifist on the front lines, is a victory of a very high order.
