# Mission: Improbable: A Pacifist’s Guide to Surviving on the Front Lines

So. The worst has happened.

You’re in a war. Not metaphorically, not spiritually, not on Twitter. A real one. Bullets. Mud. Screaming. Orders barked by people who’ve mistaken volume for authority.

And to make things worse, you're not just in a war—you’re on the *front lines*. Where people don’t so much live as *temporarily fail to die*.

And topping it all off like a sadistic cherry on a napalm sundae: **you refuse to kill**. Not directly. Not through orders. Not with buttons, not with bullets, **not even charging batteries for anything that flies**.

You don’t want to be a hero. You don’t want to be a villain. Hell, at this point you’d settle for just making it out without your conscience or intestines hanging out.

This guide is for you.

No patriotic fluff. No calls to glory. Just the hard, gritty, cowardly (read: intelligent) tactics to *not die* and *not kill*—for as long as humanly, or inhumanly, possible.

Welcome to the survivalist's paradox.
Let’s keep you breathing.
