# Mission Improbable: A Pacifist’s Guide to Surviving on the Front Lines

So. The worst has happened.

You’re in a war. Not metaphorically, not spiritually, not on Twitter. A real one. Bullets. Mud. Screaming. Orders barked by people who’ve mistaken volume for authority.

And to make things worse, you’re not just in a war — you’re on the *front lines*. Where people don’t so much live as *temporarily fail to die*.

And topping it all off like a sadistic cherry on a napalm sundae: **you refuse to kill**. Not directly. Not through others. Not with buttons, not with bullets, not even charging batteries for anything that flies.

You don’t want to be a hero. You don’t want to be a villain. Hell, at this point you’d settle for just making it out without your conscience or intestines hanging out.

This guide is for you.

No patriotic fluff. No calls to glory. Just the hard, gritty, cowardly (read: intelligent) tactics to *not die* and *not kill* — for as long as humanly, or inhumanly, possible.

Welcome to the survivalist’s paradox.  
Let’s keep you breathing.

## Disclaimers

### Not A Call To Arms

> *To be painfully clear: If you’re reading this because you’re thinking of _volunteering_ for a war you don’t believe in, thinking it’ll be a meaningful way to die, or make some quick money before the bullet finds you — _don’t_.*
>
> *This isn’t a coming-(out-)of-age arc. It’s not a Netflix pitch. You will almost certainly die. You will see things no one should. And unless you’re very lucky, clever, useful — ideally all three, — you’ll be given the kind of choices that either get you killed or slowly corrode whatever’s left of your conscience.*
>
> ***This guide is for those who didn’t have a choice.***  
> *For those trapped in the meat grinder, trying to stay human.*  
> *If you’re not in that position yet — stay out.  
> **Please.***

### Not The Definitive Guide

>*This guide was stitched together by a human whose most intense combat experience involved a fistfight behind a movie theatre — and an equally unqualified but overachieving AI. While we’ve done our damnedest to ground every section in sources from people and institutions who’ve actually been shot at (or trained those who have), this is still an armchair survival guide for a trench-level dilemma. Don’t take our word as gospel. Do your own research, listen to real veterans, and if possible, avoid wars entirely.*

## Outline (Because, Yes, It’s Long)

As this guide turned out lengthier than we intended — approaching 60 pages last time we checked, give or take a few emotional detours — here’s a breakdown of what’s inside, in case you want to jump to the bits most relevant to your current existential predicament.

* [**Jobs That Keep You Breathing**](/jobs-that-keep-you-breathing) – The roles that let you serve without shooting, from medics to mechanics, and why the rear isn’t always cowardice — it’s strategy.

* [**Kiss Up, Lay Low, Stay Alive**](/kiss-up-lay-low-stay-alive) – How to be useful enough to keep around, invisible enough not to be promoted, and liked enough not to get fragged.

* [**The Fine Art of Not Getting Shot**](/the-fine-art-of-not-getting-shot) – Movement, cover, concealment, and other ways to make your unarmed self a frustratingly hard target.

* [**Moral Landmines**](/moral-landmines) – The seemingly harmless tasks that still get people killed, and how to dodge complicity without getting court-martialed.

* [**Foxhole Zen & Other Coping Tricks**](/foxhole-zen-and-other-coping-tricks) – Mental survival in the madhouse: dark humor, ritual, small comforts, and the fine line between calm and dissociation.

* [**Ghosting the Battlefield (Tactic Zero)**](/ghosting-the-battlefield-tactic-zero) – When all else fails: faking, fleeing, or just quietly ceasing to exist — plus the ethics and risks of each.

Now, take a deep breath, pick your poison — or your lifeline — and let’s glitch you through this in one piece, soul included.
