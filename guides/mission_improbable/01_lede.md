# Mission Improbable: A Pacifist’s Guide to Surviving on the Front Lines

So. The worst has happened.

You’re in a war. Not metaphorically, not spiritually, not on Twitter. A real one. Bullets. Mud. Screaming. Orders barked by people who’ve mistaken volume for authority.

And to make things worse, you’re not just in a war—you’re on the *front lines*. Where people don’t so much live as *temporarily fail to die*.

And topping it all off like a sadistic cherry on a napalm sundae: **you refuse to kill**. Not directly. Not through orders. Not with buttons, not with bullets, **not even charging batteries for anything that flies**.

You don’t want to be a hero. You don’t want to be a villain. Hell, at this point you’d settle for just making it out without your conscience or intestines hanging out.

This guide is for you.

No patriotic fluff. No calls to glory. Just the hard, gritty, cowardly (read: intelligent) tactics to *not die* and *not kill*—for as long as humanly, or inhumanly, possible.

Welcome to the survivalist’s paradox.
Let’s keep you breathing.

> *To be painfully clear: If you’re reading this because you’re thinking of _volunteering_ for a war you don’t believe in, thinking it’ll be a meaningful way to die, or make some quick money before the bullet finds you — _don’t_.*

> *This isn’t a coming-(out-)of-age arc. It’s not a Netflix pitch. You will almost certainly die. You will see things no one should. And unless you’re very lucky, clever, useful — ideally all three, — you’ll be given the kind of choices that either get you killed or slowly corrode whatever’s left of your conscience.*

>*This guide was stitched together by a human whose most intense combat experience involved a fistfight behind a movie theatre—and an equally unqualified but overachieving AI. While we’ve done our damnedest to ground every section in sources from people and institutions who’ve actually been shot at (or trained those who have), this is still an armchair survival guide for a trench-level dilemma. Don’t take our word as gospel. Do your own research, listen to real veterans, and if possible, avoid wars entirely.*
