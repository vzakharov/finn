## Kiss Up, Lay Low, Stay Alive

Surviving war when you won’t shoot back isn’t just about your job – it’s about *how you exist* in the unit. You need to become a social Houdini: **escape notice, except when being liked helps you.** The mantra [“blend in, don’t volunteer for anything, keep your mouth shut”](https://taskandpurpose.com/culture/best-advice-veterans-military/) is classic military wisdom for a reason. 

> **“Become a social Houdini: escape notice, except when being liked helps you.”**

As a pacifist in uniform, this is doubly important. You’re already an odd duck (even if you keep it secret). Your goal is to avoid two fates: being singled out (for dangerous tasks or as a scapegoat) and being put in positions of authority where you’d have to compromise your morals. So you practice the fine art of *inconspicuous excellence*.

### Be the Gray Man (or Woman)

In basic training and beyond, smart soldiers learn that sticking out often brings trouble. If you’re too good, you get “voluntold” for risky missions; if you’re too bad, you get punished or thrown into even riskier situations as cannon fodder. You want the Goldilocks zone – **competent but not conspicuous**. 

> **“You want the Goldilocks zone – competent but not conspicuous.”**

Do your duty, meet expectations, but don’t go shining your boots so brightly that the sergeant notices his own face in them. Blend with the herd. A veteran distilled it perfectly: *“Blend in, don’t volunteer for anything, keep your mouth shut”*. 

That means if someone’s asking for volunteers to clear a minefield or lead a night patrol, your hand stays down and your gaze averts. It also means you don’t grandstand with philosophical objections at every briefing – that’s a fast track to the worst kind of attention. Lay low. Be there, but not *there*. Camouflage yourself socially as you would physically on the battlefield.

### Kiss Up (Selectively) but Never Suck Up

You do need some goodwill from the chain of command. A pacifist in the ranks might one day need an understanding officer to keep them out of a bloodier assignment. So practice *tactful deference*. Salute, say “Yes sir/ma’am” convincingly, and do small favors that make a boss’s life easier (finish paperwork promptly, manage their reports, etc.). 

> **“Be useful to your superiors, but in a non-threatening way.”**

Essentially, **be useful to your superiors**, but in a non-threatening way. Think “reliable clerk,” not “wannabe Rambo.” Officers and NCOs appreciate a soldier who quietly handles tasks without causing headaches. If you’re that person, they’re less likely to toss you into the meat grinder just to test you. 

But be wary of overdoing it – obvious sycophancy (“brown-nosing”) breeds resentment among peers and even suspicion among leaders. *Professionalism* is the sweet spot. Respect the rank above you (“always respect the rank,” as one vet advised) and never publicly embarrass a superior. 

In private, if you build a rapport, you might later manage to request assignments that align with your conscience (“Sir, I’m keen to continue in the med tent rather than join the scout platoon – I believe I’m most effective here”). If you’ve been a model soldier, there’s a chance they’ll accommodate rather than suspect ulterior motives.

### Make Yourself Indispensable (But Not Promotable)

This is a balancing act. You want your unit to value you so they *keep you around in your current role* (and don’t trade you to some frontline unit), yet you *don’t* want to be promoted into a position where you might have to order men into battle or otherwise soil your hands. 

> **“Aim for a solid B+ performance – good enough to respect, not so good they feel obligated to advance you.”**

How to do this? Focus on mastering your support role. Be the best mechanic who can fix anything, or the medic who can tape a broken leg in the dark, or the logistics wizard who keeps the ammo (or coffee) flowing efficiently. 

If you’re **the go-to specialist**, commanders might hesitate to reassign you to generic rifleman duties. They need you right where you are – fixing trucks, decoding signals, running the field kitchen, whatever it is. 

However, as you excel, *downplay the glory*. Share credit liberally (“Oh, I couldn’t have repaired that generator without Pvt. Smith’s help”). Avoid stepping on the ego of any superiors; make your excellence look like support for *their* success. 

This reduces the chance they pin a higher rank on you or move you to a “greater responsibility” (read: morally sticky) post. Many a skilled enlisted person has avoided promotion by a mix of feigned test failures and just enough minor flaws. 

For instance, if you’re too perfect on evaluation tests, you’ll get fast-tracked; instead, aim for a solid B+ performance – good enough to respect, not so good they feel obligated to advance you. If offered a promotion, can you decline? 

In some militaries formally refusing promotion isn’t allowed except by leaving, but you can certainly express that you feel “most useful in my current capacity.” If you’ve built trust, sometimes they’ll let a promotion pass. Worst case, a promotion in a support field (like Senior Medic) might still be okay – just avoid promotion that moves you into a command slot in a combat unit.

### Social Camouflage – Unit Cohesion Without Confession

You’re likely a lone pacifist wolf in a pack of warfighters. Preaching your beliefs to your squadmates is not going to win you friends at the front. It could alienate them, or worse, label you a liability. Yet you *need* their acceptance and protection. 

> **“Inside your head you can scream pacifist truths, but on the outside, project the dutiful soldier.”**

Soldiers survive by teamwork and bonds – [personal bonds are “an important role in combat motivation”](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/csls/Unit_Cohesion_and_Military_Performance_Ch5_MacCoun_Hix.pdf) and getting through hell. So, embed yourself in the unit culture as much as your principles allow. 

Share the misery honestly. Help others with their loads if you can. Laugh at their jokes (even the dark, crude ones – war breeds a dark humor and joining in shows you’re not judging). When off duty, if everyone’s cleaning weapons or playing cards, you do the same (you can clean an unloaded rifle without intent to ever fire it – consider it a mechanical meditation). 

The key is to be seen as **one of the team, just with a different job**. If they trust you as a comrade – the medic who saved their buddy, the cook who always has coffee ready, the radio operator who keeps the signals clear – they’ll want you alive as much as any sharpshooter. 

That means in battle they might cover you, drag you to cover, or at least not “accidentally” leave you exposed. Soldiers in tight units look after each other; be part of that “each other.”

On the flip side, avoid stirring divisive topics. Venting that “this war is immoral” in the middle of the trench is a quick way to get branded a troublemaker or coward. Remember, **inside your head you can scream pacifist truths, but on the outside, project the dutiful soldier**. 

It’s a performance to ensure survival. Use what sociologists call *impression management*: appear as the loyal, if quiet, member of the tribe. You’re not there to spotlight your conscience in lights; you’re there to get out alive and with your integrity *subtly* intact.

### Strategic Invisibility

When dangerous assignments get handed out, you want to be overlooked unless your role specifically is needed. Practice being somewhere on an errand or deep in a neutral task when volunteers are called. 

> **“Be the person who is always busy with something essential when non-essential (and risky) duties are being distributed.”**

For example, if you know a charge or raid is brewing, maybe you’re double-checking the medical supplies or refueling the generators at that moment. This isn’t outright refusal; it’s *preemptive sidestepping*. 

If you’re lucky, by the time anyone notices you weren’t assigned, the slots are full. In the military, timing and presence are huge – decisions often fall to whoever’s standing right there. So manage your presence. Be the person who is always busy with something essential when non-essential (and risky) duties are being distributed.

### Cultivate a Guardian Angel (or at least a Sympathetic Sergeant)

Quietly feeling out who in your command might respect a stance of principle can pay off. Maybe there’s an old sergeant who’s seen enough bloodshed and has no interest in forcing anyone to kill unnecessarily, or an officer with a philosophical bend. 

Do *not* advertise “I’m a pacifist, please shield me” – that likely won’t fly. But you can emphasize where your passion lies (“I joined to save lives, sir – that’s why I trained as a medic”). If a higher-up sees that as sincere dedication rather than cowardice, they might unofficially steer you away from things you hate. 

It happens: some commanders pragmatically place people where they perform best. If you’re stellar at patching wounds and clearly squeamish about search-and-destroy missions, a good leader might just keep you at the aid station. 

Essentially, you want someone with authority to think it’s *their* idea to keep you in a non-killing role. That way, you don’t have to object; they’re *ordering* you to stick to what you do best (the very thing you wanted).

### Never Be *Too* Absent or *Too* Present

War has its drudgery – long waits, guard duty, chores. Do your share. If you’re always shirking the lousy jobs (latrine digging, bunker cleaning) while also ducking the fighting, your peers will resent you. 

> **“While you won’t take life, you’ll risk your own comfort to save lives or make life easier for your comrades.”**

Paradoxically, pulling extra weight in the non-violent dirty work can buy you goodwill (“Yeah, Jones won’t shoot an enemy, but damn, he always volunteers to clean the latrines and haul water. Let him be.”). Show courage in nonviolent ways: run into the mortar barrage to pull a wounded friend to safety, volunteer to fix the comms under fire. 

These acts, which don’t involve killing, can earn respect. The squad might forgive that you won’t fire a rifle if they see you have guts and contribute to keeping *them* alive.

The unwritten social contract: *you watch their backs, they watch yours*. You have to fulfill that in some fashion. Maybe you’re the one with a steady hand under pressure to apply a tourniquet, or the one who stays up late to finish the logistics plan that ensures everyone gets winter jackets. 

Show that while you won’t take life, you’ll risk or expend your own comfort to save lives or make life easier for your comrades. That can neutralize a lot of potential hatred.

In summary, **survival in the warzone hierarchy means being liked enough to be protected, but not so prominent as to attract dangerous expectations**. It’s a tightrope. Blend in. Neither coward nor glory hound. 

> **“You don’t get in trouble for what you do; you get in trouble for what you get caught for.”**

One vet’s advice still rings: *“Never volunteer!”* – at least not for the dumb stuff. And another sly wisdom: [“You don’t get in trouble for what you do; you get in trouble for what you get caught for.”](https://taskandpurpose.com/culture/best-advice-veterans-military/) So if you must dodge an order or feign ignorance, do it smartly and without fanfare. Keep your moral compass on stealth mode. 

Kiss up where it counts, lay low everywhere else, and you just might stay alive and sane through this madness.
