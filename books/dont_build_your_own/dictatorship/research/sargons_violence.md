# Sargon of Akkad — Anecdotes of Violance

## Summary

Sargon of Akkad (r. 2334–2279 BCE) anchored his rule in a primal mix of spectacle and terror, from the public humiliation of defeated rivals at sacred gateways ([Wikipedia][1]) to the boastful razing of mountain fortresses “with axes of bronze” ([Wikipedia][2]). His own inscriptions and later copies immortalize campaigns that shattered city walls, corralled captives like livestock, and even calibrated the calendar by the year he “destroyed the city of Mari.”

## Anecdotes of Violence

1. **Collared Captives at Nippur**
   After routing Lugal-zage-si of Uruk, Sargon’s inscription recounts how he tore down Uruk’s walls and “led him in a collar to the gate of Enlil,” staging a ritual of submission that broadcast his absolute authority to all who witnessed ([Wikipedia][1]) ([static.secure.website][3]).

2. **Washing Weapons in the Sea**
   A Penn Museum analysis notes that, following his coastal conquests, Sargon proudly claimed he “could wash his weapons in the sea,” turning the Persian Gulf into the ultimate war-trophy basin ([Penn Museum][4]) ([Pete’s Favourite Things][5]).

3. **Razing Key City Walls**
   Contemporary records describe Sargon’s systematic destruction of urban defenses: he “conquered Ur, destroyed its walls, then conquered Eninmar and destroyed its fortifications, finally extending his rule to Lagash as far as the sea,” leaving hinterlands flattened ([Pete’s Favourite Things][5]) ([World History Encyclopedia][6]).

4. **Mountainous Destruction**
   In royal invective, Sargon proclaims that he “destroyed mighty mountains with axes of bronze,” “ascended the upper mountains,” and “besieged the country of the sea three times,” emphasising campaigns against distant realms like Dilmun ([Wikipedia][2]) ([World History Encyclopedia][7]).

5. **Brutal Year-Names**
   His regime even named years after its worst atrocities—one regnal year is recorded as “Year in which Mari was destroyed,” bureaucratically memorializing the city’s burning and pillage ([Wikipedia][2]) ([Wikipedia][8]).
