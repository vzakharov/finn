## **Chapter II: The First Dictatorship™ Franchise**

*In which Sargon expands operations, razes regional offices, and introduces Year-Based Branding*

If Narmer was the prototype — a one-mace show who unified a nation with grit, spectacle, and creative head placement — Sargon of Akkad was the rollout. The expansion pack. The man who looked at a bloody throne and thought, “Let’s scale this.”

Born a nobody (or so he claimed), Sargon’s backstory is pure legend bait: an orphan floated down the Euphrates in a pitch-sealed basket, plucked from obscurity by a humble gardener, and raised to become cupbearer to the King of Kish. But make no mistake — this was not a story about humility. It was an origin myth with IPO energy. Because not long after handing his boss a drink, Sargon apparently turned around and *took his job*. And then took everyone else’s.

### From Kish to Everywhere

Around 2334 BCE, Sargon kicked off what would become the world’s first recorded empire: the Akkadian Empire. Unlike Narmer’s unification of two squabbling neighbors, Sargon had something far more ambitious in mind: Mesopotamia, Syria, Elam, and possibly parts of Anatolia and the Persian Gulf. He wasn’t just uniting; he was steamrolling. With a standing army of 5,400 men dining daily at his court (a very early version of corporate catering), he marched from city to city like a hostile merger consultant with a very persuasive axe.

He toppled Uruk, humiliated its king (Lugal-zage-si, now best remembered as “that guy Sargon led around on a leash”), and made a point of dragging him to the sacred gate of Enlil in Nippur. Because nothing says “new management” like parading your predecessor in chains through the holiest site in Sumer.

### Brand Consistency and Bronze Hatchets

Sargon was a conqueror with an eye for the brand. His campaigns didn’t just raze cities—they renamed years. Want to know what year it was? “The Year Sargon Destroyed Mari.” Nice, clear, memorable. His conquest calendar turned military violence into a timekeeping system.

He standardized weights and measures, installed Akkadian-speaking governors, and made sure taxes flowed not just to Akkad, but *to him*. He declared himself “King of the Four Corners of the Universe,” a modest upgrade from “King of Kish,” and started referring to himself in ways that would make even a modern dictator blush.

When he finally reached the coast, he boasted that he could “wash his weapons in the sea.” Which, frankly, is the most poetic way to end a war since Achilles sulked in a tent. Also: probably not great for bronze.

### Massacre-as-a-Service

Need your city walls broken? Your mountain fortresses reduced? Your livestock reclassified as tribute? Sargon had a system. He once bragged of conquering 34 cities in a single campaign. In one inscription, he claims to have “destroyed mighty mountains with axes of bronze.” It’s unclear whether that’s metaphor, exaggeration, or early Mesopotamian deforestation, but the message is clear: resistance was futile, and terrain was optional.

His empire operated like a well-oiled—if blood-spattered—machine. Governors were installed like regional managers, beholden only to him. Local traditions were politely overwritten with imperial bureaucracy. And rebellions? He crushed them. Repeatedly. One city revolted three times. It no longer exists.

### Was Sargon a Dictator?

Well, yes. He didn’t call himself that (the Romans hadn’t invented the word yet), but functionally, he ticked every box:

* **Absolute, personal authority**? Affirmative.
* **No constitutional limits**? None to speak of.
* **Violent suppression of dissent?** Please. He had *year names* for it.
* **Centralized bureaucracy, language imposition, and personality cult?** Empire starter pack.

If Narmer invented the bloody crown, Sargon industrialized it. His was a rule-by-template model: repeatable, scalable, deadly. The world’s first dictatorship franchise, complete with brand identity, standardized oppression, and expansion goals.

And like all franchises, his legacy was mixed. The empire crumbled within a century of his death. Turns out, centralization works great until it doesn’t. But for a brief, glorious moment, Sargon held the world’s first monopoly on war, taxes, and time itself.

Eat your heart out, Alexander.
