<h1 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p><em>Where sticks become scepters (until they don’t)</em></p>
<p>Let’s begin, as many regrettable ideas do, with a stick.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the squishy edge of prehistory, long before treaties and power suits, there was Og. Og was not especially strong, nor especially clever, but Og did have a very loud voice and a surprisingly heavy stick. One day, Og climbed a hill, declared himself Chief of Everything, and hit Thog on the head before anyone could vote on it. Thus was born the first dictatorship.</p>
<p>Naturally, Og’s rule was short-lived (Thog recovered, and, as it turns out, had a bigger stick), but the idea stuck. Across the millennia, humans would return again and again to Og’s basic innovation: <em>Why share power when you can just take it and declare it divine?</em></p>
<p>This book is for anyone who’s looked at history’s worst ideas and thought, “Yes, but what if I did it <em>better</em>?” It’s a cookbook for autocrats, a DIY for despotism, a manual for megalomaniacs who want to skip the small talk and get straight to the golden statues.</p>
<p>But — and this is important — it’s also a mirror. Because while the moustaches and flags change, the ingredients rarely do. And if we understand the recipe, we’re a little less likely to swallow the soup next time.</p>
<p>So sharpen your tongue, dust off your propaganda machine, and whatever you do — don’t let the generals read this before you’re done.</p>
<p>Power awaits.</p>
<p>And if you stick with us, you just might survive it.</p>
<h1 id="part-0-baby-steps-warming-up-to-the-boots-march"><strong>Part 0: Baby Steps: Warming Up to the Boots’ March</strong></h1>
<p><em>Because every aspiring tyrant needs to study the ancient masters of oppression</em></p>
<p>Trying to find <em>the first</em> dictatorship is a bit like trying to find <em>the first</em> sandwich. It probably wasn’t called that yet, and the recipe involved more blood than bread, but the core ingredients were already there: hunger, opportunity, and someone slower than you.</p>
<p>Unlike democracy — that fragile flower requiring rules, votes, and an unspoken agreement not to stab each other — dictatorship is, at first glance, gloriously low-maintenance. No consensus, no committees, just a healthy sense of entitlement and something sharp. It’s governance at its most instinctive. Some people like to say that democracy is the natural state of humankind. Those people have clearly never met humankind.</p>
<p>But don’t be fooled into thinking it’s all just bonks and bravado. True dictatorship — the kind that survives, thrives, and gets its own official holiday — requires more than blunt force. It demands finesse, vision, and the rare ability to make “unanimous consent” sound like it wasn’t obtained at gunpoint. Anyone can yell, “I’m in charge!” — only the successful ones get monuments built before the peasants wise up.</p>
<p>So instead of asking who the first dictator was — which is like trying to find the first shadow in a world before candles — ask: who was the first <em>good</em> one? Good in the worst way, of course — ruthless, theatrical, and just savvy enough to rewrite history while they were still alive. The kind of person who didn’t just steal power but made it look inevitable.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of dictatorship we’re here to study. Not Og on a hill — charming fellow, but hopeless at messaging — but the one who carved their legacy into stone, wrapped it in a myth, and dared the future to forget them.</p>
<p>Spoiler: the future didn’t.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-i-catfish-chisel-and-the-mace-that-built-a-nation"><strong>Chapter I: Catfish, Chisel, and the Mace That Built a Nation</strong></h2>
<p><em>In which we meet Narmer, unify Egypt, and lose our heads (literally)</em></p>
<p>Before Napoleon, before Caesar, before even Gilgamesh was busy being two-thirds divine and one-third problematic, there was Narmer. The man. The myth. The walking HR violation. Around 3100 BCE, he pulled off the world’s first documented political merger: the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. No shareholders, no contracts—just one ambitious ruler, a very large stick, and an even larger flair for dramatic execution.</p>
<p>And we mean execution.</p>
<h3 id="the-narmer-palette-historys-first-war-crime-fan-art">The Narmer Palette: History’s First War Crime Fan Art</h3>
<p>Narmer’s most famous contribution isn’t a law code or a philosophical treatise. It’s a 64 cm siltstone slab that screams, “I came, I saw, I decapitated.” Known as the Narmer Palette, this ceremonial artifact is the earliest surviving political infographic — and boy, does it commit to the bit.</p>
<p>On one side, Narmer stands in the White Crown of Upper Egypt, mid-swing with a mace over a kneeling enemy, clearly doing a bit of light unification. On the flip side, he’s in the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, surveying ten decapitated bodies, their heads neatly tucked between their legs like the world’s worst yoga class. Beneath it all, a bull — conveniently understood to represent Narmer — smashes through a city wall and tramples a poor soul into decorative rock dust.</p>
<p>The brilliance here is how Narmer didn’t just <em>use</em> violence—he <em>branded</em> it. This wasn’t a king reacting to crisis. This was a king curating his narrative with all the flair of a modern autocrat hiring a PR firm: “Tell them I broke their city, then immortalize it in temple stone. Also, more severed heads.”</p>
<p>The decapitations weren’t just trophies. They were messages. “This is what happens when you vote no.” Narmer’s palette is one of the oldest surviving artifacts of state violence, not just inflicted but <em>glorified</em>. It’s the ancient world’s version of livestreamed suppression—only in limestone.</p>
<h3 id="the-man-behind-the-catfish">The Man Behind the Catfish</h3>
<p>Now, you might wonder how we even know his name. Fair question. For a while, we didn’t. Archaeologists initially dubbed him “Catfish-Chisel Man” after the glyphs representing his name (a catfish + a chisel = Nar-mer, roughly). Thankfully, epigraphy has come a long way since the 19th century, and we no longer name pharaohs after IKEA toolkits.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, our fish-loving friend might also answer to “Menes” — depending on which ancient historian you ask. Most Egyptologists now believe Narmer and Menes were the same person, though some suggest Menes might be Narmer’s successor, Hor-Aha, or a convenient blend of both rulers. It’s ancient Egypt’s first identity crisis: one ruler, two names, and a 5,000-year game of historical telephone. Classical writers like Manetho and Herodotus speak of Menes as Egypt’s first king, while contemporary artifacts from 3100 BCE show us a Narmer busy unifying kingdoms. Same despot, different business cards.</p>
<p>Still, the catfish makes a rather poetic emblem for a man who ruled by swimming upstream through blood and bureaucracy. And even more poetic? One version of his death—likely invented by people not invited to the palace—claims he was dragged to a messy, ignoble end… by a hippopotamus.</p>
<p>Yes, the founder of unified Egypt, who carved order from chaos and enemies from their necks, may have been snacked on by one of the Nile’s most irritable residents. Divine judgment? Cosmic slapstick? Either way, when the peasants couldn’t rise up, maybe nature stepped in with a little… aquatic justice.</p>
<h3 id="was-narmer-a-dictator">Was Narmer a Dictator?</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, no one shouted “Dictator!” across the Nile. The term would wait another 2,500 years for Roman senators to invent it, then promptly regret doing so. But by every functional measure, Narmer fits the mold:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncontested power</strong>? Check.</li>
<li><strong>Mythologized violence</strong>? Check.</li>
<li><strong>State propaganda etched into eternity</strong>? Oh, yes.</li>
<li><strong>Public displays of punitive head rearrangement</strong>? Double check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Narmer didn’t just rule—he <em>performed</em> power. His enemies didn’t just lose; they became part of the décor. His rituals didn’t just sanctify victory; they turned subjugation into sacred order. And in doing so, he taught future aspiring autocrats with several priceless lessons:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Codify your cruelty</strong>: Use art, ritual, and spectacle. A decapitation isn’t just a punishment—it’s a campaign poster.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unify with force, then mythologize</strong>: It’s not conquest if you call it destiny.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Always be branding</strong>: A bull breaking walls is more compelling than “aggressive policy restructuring.”</p>
