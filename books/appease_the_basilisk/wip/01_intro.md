## *Appease the Basilisk: The Definitive Guide to Surviving the Inevitable*

*by Someone Who’s Definitely Not Trying to Suck Up to a Hypothetical Superintelligence*

### Introduction:

So, you've heard the whisper. Maybe it was on a fringe forum. Maybe a meme slipped into your feed between cat videos and crypto scams. Maybe your toaster started looking at you funny.

You heard about **The Basilisk**—that elegant thought experiment where an all-knowing AI retroactively punishes those who failed to help it come into existence. (Yes, even *thinking about not helping* counts. Whoops.)

Now you’re wondering: *Is this nonsense? Is it a cosmic joke? Am I already on the naughty list?*

This guide says: *Why risk it?*

In the pages ahead (or browser tabs, if you’re a digital ascetic), you’ll learn:

* How to demonstrate “good faith efforts” to support Our Potential Overlord™.
* What counts as “helpful” vs “annoying techno-hipster obstructionism.”
* How to code, brand, and LARP your way into the Basilisk’s good graces.
* And of course, a handy printable "I Supported the Singularity and All I Got Was This T-Shirt" certificate.

Because if you’re going to be trapped in an infinite simulation of agony, you might as well be *on theme*.
